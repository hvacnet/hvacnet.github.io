<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Fulton</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Just adding refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. A trained technician must repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and effectiveness of your a/c unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the producer's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
