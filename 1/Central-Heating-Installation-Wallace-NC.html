<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
