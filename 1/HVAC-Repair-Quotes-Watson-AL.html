<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the abilities or tools needed to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
