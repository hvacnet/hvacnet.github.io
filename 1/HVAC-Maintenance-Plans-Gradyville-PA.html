<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
