<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still warms to the best temperature level.

If your home is not heating up, just be concerned. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should contact an expert to repair the unit and check.<p>
