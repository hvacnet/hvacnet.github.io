<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>For example, contaminants may collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting toxins into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption lies near a source of moisture or other outdoor toxin, it might act as a pathway to bring the contaminants inside. Or the ventilation system may not be working along with it needs to-- if debris is obstructing the outside air consumption, for example, or the filters are contaminated or badly preserved.<p>

<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, unpredictable natural compounds ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce negative health conditions.

<p>Radiant heating includes installing coils or pipes in the flooring, supplying heat from below and moving up. It provides an even, total heat temperature throughout the room. Without any moving parts, it's comfortable and really quiet, and it doesn't stimulate as much dust and allergens, as compared to forced-air systems. It also doesn't produce any drafts, and removing the requirement to blow air makes it more energy effective.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. When every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
