<p>New air conditioning unit typically range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER rating indicates higher energy efficiency and potentially lower energy expenses.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
