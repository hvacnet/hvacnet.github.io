<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
