<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, up until the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under a number of owners. Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to purchase what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>

Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
