<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out.

So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
