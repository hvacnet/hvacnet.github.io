<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about potential impacts of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's instructions, particularly instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater properly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
