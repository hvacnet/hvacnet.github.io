Every maintenance task may need absolutely different actions and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being examined. Installations can also vary significantly, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. Sometimes, totally new ductwork might need to be installed in a structure that had none prior to.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, an expert service individual must be required practically any maintenance aside from routine cleaning.

PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them.
