<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Through normal use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning system may end up being very filthy.

The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic parts are examineded for correct function and general condition. This is an excellent chance to determine parts that are used or malfunctioning. When the issue is reasonably minor, changing them to repair the air conditioning may be a lot less expensive.<p>
