<h3>Floor Heating System in Magnolia TX</h3>

With a little preventative maintenance and some fundamental understanding, you can take instant steps to enhance your indoor air quality today.<p>
<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
