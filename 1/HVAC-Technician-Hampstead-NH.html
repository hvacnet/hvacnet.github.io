<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
