<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, given that it is secured inside. When it does require to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>

The 2 operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
