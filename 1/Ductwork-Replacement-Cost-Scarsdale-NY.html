<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
