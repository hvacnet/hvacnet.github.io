<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
