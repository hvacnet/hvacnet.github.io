<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Just be worried if your home is not heating up. However, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you must call in a specialist to examine and repair the system.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
