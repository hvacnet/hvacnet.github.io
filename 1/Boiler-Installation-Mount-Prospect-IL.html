<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
