<p>There are lots of reasons that this can occur. The bright side is that you can resolve much of these aspects by yourself without the requirement to require expert aid. Start by opening the heat signs up and after that carry on to inspecting the thermostat settings. Next, examine the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover. You can also examine the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and check the standing pilot burner to make sure it is lit.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
