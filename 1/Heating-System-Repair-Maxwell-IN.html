<h3>HVAC Technician in Maxwell IN</h3>
<p>As kept in mind, incorrect temperature and humidity levels, and too little or too much air circulation might also add to employee health grievances. Temperature level levels should vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air circulation must be avoided. Maintenance of correct temperatures and humidity levels and correct air flow will help to reduce the event of upper breathing signs, and, possibly, skin rashes.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of ac system, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to preserve and understand.<p>
