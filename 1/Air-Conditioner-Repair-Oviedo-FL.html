<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find an honest AC man and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
