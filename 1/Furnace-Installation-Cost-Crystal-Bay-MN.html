<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
