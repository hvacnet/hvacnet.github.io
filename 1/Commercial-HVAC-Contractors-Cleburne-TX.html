<p>Central air units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home.

Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
