<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

<p>As noted, inappropriate temperature and humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation may likewise add to worker health grievances. Temperature level levels must vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air circulation must be avoided.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leakages.
