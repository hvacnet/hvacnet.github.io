<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

A/c repair is no different. You constantly want to work with a professional to repair your system, so you can have the comfort associated relying on a professional in the field.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
