Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new building and construction (homes generally use between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, brand-new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
