<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
