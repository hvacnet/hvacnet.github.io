He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
