Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during brand-new building (houses usually use in between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.

<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
