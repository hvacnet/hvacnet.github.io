<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
