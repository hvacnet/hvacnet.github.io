Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, see Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
