<h3>What to Search for When Hiring an Delong IN HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
