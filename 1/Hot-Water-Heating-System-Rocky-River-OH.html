Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not only the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
