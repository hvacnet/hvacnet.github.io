<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the concern and fixed really rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
