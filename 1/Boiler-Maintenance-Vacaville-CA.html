Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>

<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might notice moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your medical professional about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you each time they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was six months prior to the present one expired. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
