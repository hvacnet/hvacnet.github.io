<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, workplaces and homes matters, especially because we invest most of our lives indoors. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the a/c unit is large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the ac system will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, since some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
