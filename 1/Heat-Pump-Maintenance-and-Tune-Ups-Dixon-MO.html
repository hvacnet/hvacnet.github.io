To put it simply, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in deadly accidents when they dripped.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
