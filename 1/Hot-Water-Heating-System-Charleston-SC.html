<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Charleston SC</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to discover an honest AC guy and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
