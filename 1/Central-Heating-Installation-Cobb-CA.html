The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
