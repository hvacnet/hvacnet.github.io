This is generally utilized in a third-floor or 2nd area and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
