<p>Cooling and refrigeration are supplied through the removal of heat. Heat can be removed through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are described as refrigerants A refrigerant is used either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is used to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a complimentary cooling system which utilizes pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (normally water or a glycol mix).<p>

<p>Both must be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to regularly clean the condenser coil.
