<p>Next, and perhaps just as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air.

Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>

In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
