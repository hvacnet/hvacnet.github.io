<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
