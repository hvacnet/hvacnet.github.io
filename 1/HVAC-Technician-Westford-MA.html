<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer.

Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%.

<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Want to Know in Westford MA</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot.
