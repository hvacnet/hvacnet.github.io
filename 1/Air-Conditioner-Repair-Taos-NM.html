<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy efficient approaches of heating or cooling a house.

<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Taos NM</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
