<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise create particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine.
