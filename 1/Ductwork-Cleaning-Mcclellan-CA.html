<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using smart innovation.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
