Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to determining the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of unit for your home also depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
