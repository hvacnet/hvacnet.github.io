<p>While toxin levels from individual sources might not position a considerable health danger by themselves, most houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious danger from the cumulative results of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that most people can take both to reduce the threat from existing sources and to avoid new problems from taking place. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to act that can lower the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
