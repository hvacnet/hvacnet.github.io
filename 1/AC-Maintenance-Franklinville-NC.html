ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%.

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
