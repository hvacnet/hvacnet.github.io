<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at West Sacramento CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
