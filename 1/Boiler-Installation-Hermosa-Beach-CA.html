<p>Iâ $ m really picky with my stuff. I like my equipment and home appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs. So purchasing this a/c unit to replace my old one was rather of a challenging fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Am delighted I got this though due to the fact that it has actually restored my faith in excellent production. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this brand-new Carrier I got given that I bought it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s simply perfect.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years ago and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
