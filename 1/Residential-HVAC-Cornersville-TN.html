<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Most HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that enable homeowner to control the temperature level and set it on a schedule. For instance, you can set the thermostat to lower the heat when you're not in home to conserve cash on the energy expenses and ensure the system isn't overloaded. A professional technician will check the thermostat throughout the annual maintenance to guarantee the real temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. If there's a difference in the temperature level, the technician needs to examine the thermostat's efficiency or examine the entire HVAC system.<p>
