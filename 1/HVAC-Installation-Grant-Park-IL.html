<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Grant Park IL</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really happy that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the a/c unit before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
