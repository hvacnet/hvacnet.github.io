<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
