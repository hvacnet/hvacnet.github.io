<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>You could upgrade to the greatest effectiveness equipment readily available and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days.
