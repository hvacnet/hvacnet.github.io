<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the home. Pollutants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering the house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items.
