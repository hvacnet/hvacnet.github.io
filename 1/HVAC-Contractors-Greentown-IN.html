<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not only will obstructed vents and signs up affect your convenience, they can also lead to duct leaks due to excessive air pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused spaces is NOT a good concept. You won't save any money and will end up triggering more issues for your heater.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really helpful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
