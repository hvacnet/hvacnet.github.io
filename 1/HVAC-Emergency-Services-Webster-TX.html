<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

Greater priced AC unit costs will include greater energy performance levels referred to as the SEER rating. The size of the unit will also make a various in AC system rates. The HVAC brand name you choose will also affect overall installation costs. Higher end central AC systems will cost more upfront. However, better brands normally come with a longer life expectancy, much better guarantees, and smarter innovation built in to fully manage your home's temperature level.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
