Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
