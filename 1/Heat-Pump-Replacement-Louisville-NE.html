<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Louisville NE</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
