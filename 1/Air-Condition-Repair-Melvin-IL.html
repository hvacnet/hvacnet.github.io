<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we advise utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes.
