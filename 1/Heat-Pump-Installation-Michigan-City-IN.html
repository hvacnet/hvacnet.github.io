In some cases, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness.
