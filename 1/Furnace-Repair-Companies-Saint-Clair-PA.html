<h3>Air Condition Service in Saint Clair PA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner".

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
