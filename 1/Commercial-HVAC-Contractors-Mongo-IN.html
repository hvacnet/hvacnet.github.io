Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.

<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for homeowners to think about.
