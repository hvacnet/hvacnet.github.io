<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of individuals who reside in the house. Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Infections and bacteria, animal dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
