<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Improper modification, often shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you buy a new gas range or variety, consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never use a gas stove to heat your house. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
