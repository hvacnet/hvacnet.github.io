<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
