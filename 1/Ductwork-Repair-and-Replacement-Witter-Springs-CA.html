<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they give me priority and a lower rate.
