<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect adjustment, typically indicated by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue.

Never utilize a gas range to heat your house. Constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
