<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors.
