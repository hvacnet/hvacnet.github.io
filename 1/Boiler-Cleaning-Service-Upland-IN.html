As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, because it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>

<p>The primary health effect related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
