<h3>Furnace Repair Near Me in Western Springs IL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
