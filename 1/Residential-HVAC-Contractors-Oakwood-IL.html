<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi yearly maintenance today. Trace was on time, considerate, and respected my home by constantly using boot coverings when entering my home. He demonstrated the points of inspection and also advised I have a UV light set up due to a small accumulation of mold collecting in the air handler, which he thoroughly cleaned the outside and examined compressor coils as well as ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by utilizing a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He also eliminated the leaves that accumulated inside the interior of the compressor system and suggested a solution to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I got an in-depth email report of the evaluation describing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I extremely recommend him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.
