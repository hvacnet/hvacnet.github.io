<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in effectiveness advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be set up. Since an unit is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy.

<p>A geothermal heating system does not create its power by burning fossil fuels such as gas, oil, or coal. Rather, it takes in heat from within the earth.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room a/c offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
