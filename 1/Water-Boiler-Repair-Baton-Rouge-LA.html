This action is important so the system isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

Direct exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes caught in structures and concentrations construct up inside your home.<p>
