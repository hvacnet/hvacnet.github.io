<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
