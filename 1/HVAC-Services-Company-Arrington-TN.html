<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Arrington TN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
