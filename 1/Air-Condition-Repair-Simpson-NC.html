<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
