<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.

Simply few of outdoor units do not aggravate the visual appearance of the building.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
