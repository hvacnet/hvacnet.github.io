<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
