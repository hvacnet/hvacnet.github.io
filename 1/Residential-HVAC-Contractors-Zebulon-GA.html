<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Zebulon GA</h3>
<p>Sean was very valuable. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
