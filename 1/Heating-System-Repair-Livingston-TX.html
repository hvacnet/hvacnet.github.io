<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item.

<p>Due to the fact that an a/c unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
