<p>The most common kind of home heater in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat. With a typical cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly option, however more recent systems can be very energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems typically accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly effective gas furnaces can achieve AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
