<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
