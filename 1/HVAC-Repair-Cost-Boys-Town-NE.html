<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>As discussed above, activating your new under tile flooring heating unit too soon, prior to the mortar has actually treated, can trigger the grout to split or to not adhere correctly, and might void the warranty of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile split when the system was run prior to the substance had cured. And mortar manufacturers might decline warranty coverage if you do not follow their directions.<p>
