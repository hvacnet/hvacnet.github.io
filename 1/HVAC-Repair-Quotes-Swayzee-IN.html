Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Switch off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>

Before we design and set up any systems, we schedule a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these enhancements. Standard enhancements generally consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest numerous certified home Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>
