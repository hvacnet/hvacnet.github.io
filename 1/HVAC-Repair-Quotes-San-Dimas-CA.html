<h3>AC Service in San Dimas CA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
