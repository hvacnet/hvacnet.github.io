Such a tool ought to recognize the variety of individuals affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; figure out where they are located within the office; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health signs or diseases; determine all machines run in the work environment; indicate the kind of outdoors air contamination; and identify potential sources of job stress.<p>
<p>Employ specialists and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated professionals carry out far better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.
