<h3>What Exactly Are Inverted Heat Pumps in New Middletown IN?</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and extreme wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
