<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside workplaces, schools, and other offices is essential not just for workers' comfort but likewise for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been tied to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, problem focusing, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some specific illness have been linked to specific air contaminants or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger immediate signs but can lead to cancer after many years.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems.

Kids might have higher exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
