<p>A specific ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path. A basic ac system transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, given that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
