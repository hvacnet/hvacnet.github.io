<p>We take a look at ideas prior to we supply advice to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively.

There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller wall-mounted units, ductless splits permit you to prevent the requirement for a complete duct system like most other cooling systems need.
