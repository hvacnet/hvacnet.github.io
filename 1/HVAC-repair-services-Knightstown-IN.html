<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
