<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this.
