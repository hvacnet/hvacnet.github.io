<p>The very first air conditioning system and refrigerators employed hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
<h3>AC Maintenance in Saratoga CA</h3>
<p>It's not suggested for uncertified individuals to repair & check a/c & HVAC devices. There is a risk of electric shock & death if not properly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. It would be best if you left it to a skilled ac repair Houston Midtown tech for correct HVAC medical diagnosis. When checking your air conditioning devices to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch, constantly make sure. Be very careful when inspecting capacitors, even with the air conditioning system off. Capacitors can hold a high voltage charge, even with the power turned off. An unanticipated discharge from an air conditioning capacitor can cause extreme injury or death.<p>
