Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems comparable to those utilized in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electrical energy, they release far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>

<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it pertains to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
