<p>Today's house radiant heat systems maximize infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a home is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally situated in one location like a bathroom floor or be installed throughout the whole sub-surface of the home's floorings. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are generally utilized in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
