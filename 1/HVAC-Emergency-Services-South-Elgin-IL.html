<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not use this.

<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time using Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is knowledgeable with these gadgets).

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
