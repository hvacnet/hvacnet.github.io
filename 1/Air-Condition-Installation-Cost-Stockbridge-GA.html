<p>Lots of commercial structures use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that belong to the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also utilize natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outside air presented into an area per an unit of time, and is typically revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them until they have been effectively dried. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
