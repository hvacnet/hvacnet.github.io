Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
