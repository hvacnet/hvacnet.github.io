<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most affordable if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
