<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have actually been effectively dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
