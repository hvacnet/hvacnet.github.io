<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
