<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
