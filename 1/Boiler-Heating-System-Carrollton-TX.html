<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and harden-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>

It's time to call a professional if at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something appears unusual or you lose confidence. Likewise, if the process does not work, something else is incorrect and you require a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you need to do it often, it's probably time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
