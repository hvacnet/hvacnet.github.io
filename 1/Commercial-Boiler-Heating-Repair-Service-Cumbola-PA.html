<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>

The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
