<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>You're going to need to keep it in great condition when you've got the best furnace chose out and installed. Looking after your furnace does not simply include repairing it when it breaks.

You must set up preventive maintenance for your furnace a minimum of as soon as a year.<p>
