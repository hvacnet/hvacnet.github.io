<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Picking the ideal size air conditioner is a vital part of the HVAC purchasing procedure and one that you'll require an HVAC professional to help you with. Here's why buying the right size air conditioner matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too big, you'll end up wasting money and energy. And if it's too small, you will not get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>Old heaters often start to make some unusual sounds as they get towards completion of their life. Have you heard any banging, popping, rattling, or screeching noises coming from your furnace?

Does your blower turn on and off regularly or does it blow cold air sometimes? This is a sign that your furnace might need to be changed if so.<p>
