<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Fort Lupton CO</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the service technicians thought they simply didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
