<p>If you have a large home, a house with high ceilings, a house with numerous windows or a home with insufficient insulation, heating your floorings rather than the air may not suffice to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed.

<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is permitted to increase and flow out high structure openings to the outside (stack effect ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can utilize really little energy, but care needs to be taken to guarantee comfort.

Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and disperse cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
