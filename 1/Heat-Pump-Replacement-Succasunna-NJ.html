<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
