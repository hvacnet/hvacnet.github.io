<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>You could update to the highest effectiveness gear offered and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The typical home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air escapes the system.<p>
