<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne.
