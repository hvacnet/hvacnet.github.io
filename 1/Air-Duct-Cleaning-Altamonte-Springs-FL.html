Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
