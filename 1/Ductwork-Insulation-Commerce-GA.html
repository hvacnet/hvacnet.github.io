<p>Expert heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately fail. HVAC experts suggest following this standard guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
