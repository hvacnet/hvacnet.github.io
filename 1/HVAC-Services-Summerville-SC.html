<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Fantastic AC Repair Company at Summerville SC</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons a furnace will run continuously is since something is unclean or clogged up Before trying to fix any problem, require time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Inspect the furnace blower for blocking and clean it if the air filter is great to go. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, get in touch with an experienced technician.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the specialists believed they simply didn't appear right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
