<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
