<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are readily available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Care! Climate Pro is dependable and genuinely appreciated us and our situation. We came home one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that exact same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated home again. What's most amazing was that this all taken place during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
