<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in place. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repeated usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in fractures and holes. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.. a really helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
