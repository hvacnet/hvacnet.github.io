<p>Compounding the kept in mind health symptoms may be task tension. In part, due to numerous elements of office automation, the most difficult elements of workplace work are increasing. Health symptoms associated with task tension include mental and physical stress such as disappointment, stress and anxiety, irritability, anger, depression, stomach or gastro-intestinal disturbances, and muscle and mental stress.

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items.

This can result in the potential for significant health problems.<p>
