<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
