<p>Sean was really helpful. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
