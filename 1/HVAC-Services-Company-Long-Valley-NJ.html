<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Long Valley NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
