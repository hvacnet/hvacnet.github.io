<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.
