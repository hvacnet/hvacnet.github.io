<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Carrollton KY</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run constantly is due to the fact that something is stopped up or filthy Prior to attempting to fix any issue, require time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, inspect the furnace blower for clogging and clean it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work. Get in touch with a skilled technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
