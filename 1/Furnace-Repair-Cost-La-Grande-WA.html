<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in La Grande WA</h3>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of individuals.<p>
