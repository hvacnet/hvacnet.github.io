<p>Because things ran efficiently without any sound, I was very delighted in the start. Additionally, I saw noticeable modifications in my electrical energy expenses. After 2 years, things started to change. There have been uncomfortable noises. I got it fixed and examined. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. Overall, it has been a great experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the beginning. But then recognized Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler normally take place when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In most cases, the belt is poorly aligned or worn and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>
