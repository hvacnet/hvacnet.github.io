<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system cooling", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
