<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
