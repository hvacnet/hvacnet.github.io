<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in numerous thousands of asthmatic children, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose inflammation.

<p>Normally the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more affordable technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
