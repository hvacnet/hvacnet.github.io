<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd problem that occasionally shows up. It is really essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible when you do notice your furnace behaving oddly. The faster you respond to problems with your furnace, the simpler they are to repair. Waiting to call for repairs will only make the issue worse, and typically more expensive.<p>
<p>There are lots of things to consider when trying to determine how often I ought to replace my air conditioning filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has a special DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your cooling filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better right choice on how often your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less typically you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one a/c filter need replacing more frequently.<p>

You can usually conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are excellent that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly gotten rid of from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outside sources, including polluted soil tracked within, and use of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
