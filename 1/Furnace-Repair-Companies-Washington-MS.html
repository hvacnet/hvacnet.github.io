Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy.
