<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Lewisburg TN</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "general responsibility provision" applies. This provision, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that an employer should supply a healthy and safe office. Hence, making sure the air is of excellent quality is the employer's task.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
