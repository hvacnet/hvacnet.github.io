Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, dependable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find an honest AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
