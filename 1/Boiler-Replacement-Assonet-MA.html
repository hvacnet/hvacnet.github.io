<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>There's a huge difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common type of house heating-- convection. Over the previous century, most of homes in cooler climates were warmed by convection, rather than radiation.

<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>

However, presuming they are set up properly and correctly looked after, the likelihood of them having problems is little.<p>
