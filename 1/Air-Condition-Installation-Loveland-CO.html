We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years back and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
