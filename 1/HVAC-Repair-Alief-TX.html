Maintenance of appropriate temperatures and humidity levels and appropriate air circulation will assist to lower the occurrence of upper respiratory symptoms, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
