<h3>Air Condition Repairing in Shelbyville KY</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
