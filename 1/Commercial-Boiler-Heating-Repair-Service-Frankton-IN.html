<p>The very first air conditioning system and refrigerators used combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928.

The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
