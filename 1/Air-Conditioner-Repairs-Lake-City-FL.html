<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not know why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.
