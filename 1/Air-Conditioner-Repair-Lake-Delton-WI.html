<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
