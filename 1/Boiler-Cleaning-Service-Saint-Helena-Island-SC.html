It likewise avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
