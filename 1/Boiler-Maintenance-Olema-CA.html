Damaging direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is poorly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>Measurement treatments are being established and demonstrated to assess building ventilation and indoor pollutant concentrations. These procedures vary from sophisticated tracer gas methods utilized predominantly in constructing research efforts to less involved treatments that can be employed by developing operators. NIST scientists are continually establishing new test procedures, and then showing them in the field to evaluate their expediency and reliability. The efforts in which these treatments are demonstrated in the field has actually led to the development of a crucial database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and healthcare facilities, automobiles such as cars and trucks, trains, submarines, airplanes and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are controlled with regard to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
