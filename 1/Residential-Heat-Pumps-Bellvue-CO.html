Such a tool should recognize the number of individuals impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved workers; identify where they lie within the workplace; show when the symptoms take place (time of day, day of week, and season); offer a list of specific health symptoms or illnesses; recognize all machines run in the workplace; indicate the kind of outdoors air contamination; and determine possible sources of task stress.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
