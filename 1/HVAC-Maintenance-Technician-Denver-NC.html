Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
