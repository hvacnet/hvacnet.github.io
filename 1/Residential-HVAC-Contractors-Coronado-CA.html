They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
