<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been used commonly in a range of building construction products for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have actually prohibited numerous asbestos products. Makers have likewise voluntarily limited uses of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most commonly found in older houses, in pipeline and furnace insulation materials, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other finish products, and floor tiles.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can install controls which immediately closed down the heat pump if temperature levels reach and drop below freezing. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
