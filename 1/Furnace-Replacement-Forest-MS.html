<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
