<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that perfect temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, there has actually been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have actually been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in lab experiments.

Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered due to the fact that extremely moist soil might promote the development of microbes which can impact allergic people.<p>
