<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.

As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a vehicle radiator or common family air conditioning unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
