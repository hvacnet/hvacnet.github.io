<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is sincere, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's tough to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
