<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the flooring.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, go to Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
