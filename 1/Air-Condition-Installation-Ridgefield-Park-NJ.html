<p>Professional heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC experts suggest following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio.

Basically, SEER provides more information based on how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The higher the system's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
