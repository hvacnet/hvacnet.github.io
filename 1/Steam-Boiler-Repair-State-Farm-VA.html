<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in State Farm VA</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more severe with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are typically installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run since it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
