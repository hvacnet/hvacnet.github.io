<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them until they have actually been effectively dried. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
