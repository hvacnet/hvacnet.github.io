<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Brazil IN</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you hire to install your central air system. In fact, you can even Do It Yourself, in spite of our strong suggestion not to do so. Anticipate to pay in between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to install central air if you do take our recommendation. Moreover, cooling contractors might charge an extra $50 to $200 for extra materials and devices.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
