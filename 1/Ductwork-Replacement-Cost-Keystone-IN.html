<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Services in Keystone</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Keystone IN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
