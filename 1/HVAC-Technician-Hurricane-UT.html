<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They met my needs totally by supplying a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
