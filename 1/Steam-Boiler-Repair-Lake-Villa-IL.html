<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
