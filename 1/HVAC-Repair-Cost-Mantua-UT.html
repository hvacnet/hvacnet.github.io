The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract..
