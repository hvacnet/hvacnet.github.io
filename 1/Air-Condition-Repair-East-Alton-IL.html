<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly cure and solidify-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
