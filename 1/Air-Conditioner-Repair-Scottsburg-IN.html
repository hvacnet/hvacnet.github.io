First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
