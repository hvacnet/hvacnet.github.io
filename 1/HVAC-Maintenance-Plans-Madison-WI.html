<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, particularly if you make it part of a develop or renovation task. For example, Warmup's StickyMat solution can be installed as a Do It Yourself project as it is simple to set with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily attached to the mesh, all set to be rolled out in location. Plus, there's even an added cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
