<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
