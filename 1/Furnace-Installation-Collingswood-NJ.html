<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>In houses, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood items used adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is generally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.<p>
<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
