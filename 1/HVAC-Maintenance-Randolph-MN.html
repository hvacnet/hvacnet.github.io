My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>I highly recommend using this service. Very reputable incredibly good. Looked after a part that was not covered under guarantee fast and effective and did not have to pay a leg and an arm to get it done.

I am presently on the maintance strategy. He takes care of it twice a year with out needing to be advised to do it.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
