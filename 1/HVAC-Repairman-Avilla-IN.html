<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was really happy they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
