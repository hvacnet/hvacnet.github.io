<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in Buffalo</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
