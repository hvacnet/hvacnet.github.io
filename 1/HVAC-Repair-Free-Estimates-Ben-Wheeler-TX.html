Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat circulation over the entire surface of a flooring warms the lower half of the room, enveloping occupants in heat at a lower general temperature level-- sometimes up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heating unit."
