<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Want to Know in San Francisco CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
