<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Picking the Ideal HVAC System For Your Project in Anderson AL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>An excellent place to start is to compare your oil or natural gas furnace age to the national average. The average life expectancy of furnaces in homes today is in between 16 and 20 years. If your furnace is close to this age or older, you should start shopping. Shopping for a replacement furnace in an emergency does not allow time for you to make your best decision. The majority of people choose to change their furnace as a prepared home improvement rather than a panic replacement when your furnace is failing or has already normal lifespan of a warm air furnace will differ based upon its operating environment, that's why it is necessary to have the system serviced routinely by a qualified technician. They will be able to effectively examine the condition of the furnace and make any recommendations.<p>

The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in.
