<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and final flooring finish. This is usually utilized in a second or third-floor  location and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
