<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced.

In this case, the control system is extremely crucial to maintaining a proper temperature level.<p>

This indicates a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
