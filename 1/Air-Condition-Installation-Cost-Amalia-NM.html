"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced.
