<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
