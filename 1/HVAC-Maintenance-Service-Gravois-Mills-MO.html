<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.
