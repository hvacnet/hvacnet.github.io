<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
