<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
