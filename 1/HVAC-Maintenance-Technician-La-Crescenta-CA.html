<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at La Crescenta CA</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
