<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Piney River VA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>Everything You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Piney River VA</h3>
<p>I was really happy in the beginning because things ran smoothly without any noise. Furthermore, I saw visible changes in my electricity expenses. After two years, things began to alter. There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it examined and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. In general, it has been an excellent experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. But then realized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
