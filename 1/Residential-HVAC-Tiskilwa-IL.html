<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide guidance to replace instead of repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
