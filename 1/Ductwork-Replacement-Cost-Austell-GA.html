<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
