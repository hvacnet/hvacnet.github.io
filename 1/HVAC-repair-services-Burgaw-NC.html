<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

No matter where you are in the installation process, we can help by answering any concerns that you have, fixing problems that you've been struggling with, and thereby making your central air conditioning installation as pain-free as possible.

<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
