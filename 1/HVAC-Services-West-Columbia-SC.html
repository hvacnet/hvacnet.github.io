<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
