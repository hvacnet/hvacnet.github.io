<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
