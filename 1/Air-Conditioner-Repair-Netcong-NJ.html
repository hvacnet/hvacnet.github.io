<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
