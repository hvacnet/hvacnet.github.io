<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are normally not very effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not accomplish an effectiveness higher than 90%.

<p>As discussed above, triggering your brand-new under tile floor heating system too soon, before the mortar has actually cured, can cause the grout to crack or to not adhere correctly, and might void the service warranty of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile split when the system was run before the compound had actually cured.
