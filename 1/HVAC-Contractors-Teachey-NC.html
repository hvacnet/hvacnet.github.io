<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
