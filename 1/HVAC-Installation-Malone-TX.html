<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very handy in gathering information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
