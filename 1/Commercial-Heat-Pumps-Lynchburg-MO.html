<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
