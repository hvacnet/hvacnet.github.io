<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is created for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building products, smoking, household products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in made items. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as a part of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and coating items.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators used hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost.
