Most commonly they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if individuals mainly remain seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending upon what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensor accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are normally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
