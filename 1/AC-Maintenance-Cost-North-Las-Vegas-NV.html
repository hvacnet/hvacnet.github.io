<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

They'll look for torn and damaged wires and replace them in order to reduce the risk of fire and element failure.<p>
