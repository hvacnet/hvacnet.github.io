<p>To assist health centers dealing with patients with the unique coronavirus (COVID-19), Provider launched the OptiClean portable negative air maker, which gets rid of and cleans up air possibly contaminated by the virus.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
