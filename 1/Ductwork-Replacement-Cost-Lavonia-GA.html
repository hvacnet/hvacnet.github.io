AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two.

<p>Firstly, The after hours answering service agent, John, was professional and extremely courteous. Secondly, Gracion W is a prompt, educated technician. He was at my house within the time he offered me, repaired the problem while discussing the issue then stayed several minutes to ensure it was working appropriately. The concern was repaired in a matter of time that I've never ever seen before while being a house owner for ten years. I also suggest among the Protection Strategies, which I belong to, if you like to save money. Thank you." Karen P.<p>

<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a very pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
