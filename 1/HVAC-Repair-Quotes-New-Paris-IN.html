<p>Since they eliminate wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler.

Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
