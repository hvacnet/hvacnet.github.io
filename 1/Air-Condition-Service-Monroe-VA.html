<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
