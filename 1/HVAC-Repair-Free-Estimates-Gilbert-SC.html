<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable.
