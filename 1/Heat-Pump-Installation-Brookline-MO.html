He committed to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up examination results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
