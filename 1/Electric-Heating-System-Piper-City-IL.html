<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
