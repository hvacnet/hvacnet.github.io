<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne toxins streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we advise using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
