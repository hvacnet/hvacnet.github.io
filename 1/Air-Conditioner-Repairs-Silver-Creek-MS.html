<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
