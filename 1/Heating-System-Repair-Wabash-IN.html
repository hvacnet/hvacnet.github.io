<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, germs, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if necessary, update the structure envelope.
