<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends on the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, variety in price from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps normally need excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
