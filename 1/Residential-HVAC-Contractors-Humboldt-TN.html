<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Since as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated performance advantage. Due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because a system is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
