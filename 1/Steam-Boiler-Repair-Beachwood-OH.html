<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Don't place the condenser under a deck or completely confine it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will decrease the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.
