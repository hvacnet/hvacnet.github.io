<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
