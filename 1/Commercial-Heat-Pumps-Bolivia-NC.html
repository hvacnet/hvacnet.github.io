<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
