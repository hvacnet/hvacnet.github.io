<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have been around considering that the days of the Romans. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and an elementary pumping machine to distribute warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat transferred heat to other posts in the spaces, including the human residents.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in performance benefit. Since they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since a system is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
