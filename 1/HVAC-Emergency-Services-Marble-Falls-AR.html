<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage. Ductless heatpump are great for additions because they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your automobile.

During high use months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
