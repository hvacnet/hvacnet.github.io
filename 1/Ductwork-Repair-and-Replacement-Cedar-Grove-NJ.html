<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
