These convection heating units are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat.
