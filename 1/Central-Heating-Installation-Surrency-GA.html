<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Because an unit is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Your Evaluation This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan always makes himself available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is knowledgeable with these gadgets). I have absolutely nothing however excellent things to say - he has taken great care of my heating and AC needs. Quick action - fast resolution.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
