<h3>The Way to Get Rid of Boiler Problems in South Milwaukee WI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We picked getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is among our greatest utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
