<p>Learn More About PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on preserving it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the skills or tools needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and correct airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
