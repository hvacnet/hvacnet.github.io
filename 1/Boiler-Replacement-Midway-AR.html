<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
