Likewise, if the a/c unit smells bad, there might be germs buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your house.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
