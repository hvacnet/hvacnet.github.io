<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they need to be placed. The majority of commonly they are mounted at height-level or somewhat lower, if people mainly stay seated in that specific location. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending on what toxin you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensing unit accordingly.

I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
