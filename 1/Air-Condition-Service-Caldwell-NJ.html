<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise a choice for homeowners to think about. Many times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically just available for larger homes due to their high power and capability.
