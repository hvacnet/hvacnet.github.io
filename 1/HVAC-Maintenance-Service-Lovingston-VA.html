<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electricity or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces.

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold.

Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

Does your blower turn on and off regularly or does it blow cold air sometimes? If so, this is a sign that your furnace might require to be changed.<p>
