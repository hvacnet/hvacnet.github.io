<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Saint George SC</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might go into nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
