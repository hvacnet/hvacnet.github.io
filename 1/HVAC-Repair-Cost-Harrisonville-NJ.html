<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
