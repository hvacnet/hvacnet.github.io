<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Its distinct function is the existence of one primary external system that linked to several indoor units.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
