<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from usage.

Heaters that kick on often might be because of a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
