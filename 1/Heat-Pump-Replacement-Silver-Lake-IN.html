The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain since they only partially eliminate the radon decay products and do not reduce the quantity of radon entering the house.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers further info on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air contaminants.<p>
