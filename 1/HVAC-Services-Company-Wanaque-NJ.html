<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in Wanaque NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers guarantee would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they identified the issue and repaired extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
