<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
