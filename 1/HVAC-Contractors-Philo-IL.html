<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material with time.
