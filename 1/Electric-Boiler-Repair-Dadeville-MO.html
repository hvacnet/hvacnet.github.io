<p>Oil heating systems are typically not really effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not attain a performance higher than 90%.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
