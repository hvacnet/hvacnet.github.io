<p>For whole house setups, it's difficult, if nearly impossible, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing house, particularly a hydronic system.

This is a lot more cost-effective on a smaller sized scale. Bigger restorations like additions to a house might be suitable for a larger scale and more costly hydronic system.<p>
