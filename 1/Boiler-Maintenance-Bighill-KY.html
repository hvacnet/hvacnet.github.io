<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the essential evaluations from the city.
