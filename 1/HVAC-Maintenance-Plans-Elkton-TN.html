<p>The properties and composition of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground. These must be taken into account prior to choosing the best design of an underground cooling and heating system. Soil with positive heat transfer properties needs less pipes to attain the wanted underground heating and cooling effect, while those with decreased thermal conductivity will need more pipelines.<p>

<p>Next, and possibly just as essential when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
