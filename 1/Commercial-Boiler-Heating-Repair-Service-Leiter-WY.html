<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Power resources: Confirm your access to electrical resources. Many older homes have actually limited capability to include significant appliances at the level of a central air conditioner. If that's the case with your home, a ductless heatpump might be the best suitable for you, since it requires less electrical service, or for a central air conditioning unit, new electrical service can often be included. Your AC installer will know what to try to find.<p>
