<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
