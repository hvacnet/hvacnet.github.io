<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Macedonia OH</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very happy they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
