<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood items used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).
