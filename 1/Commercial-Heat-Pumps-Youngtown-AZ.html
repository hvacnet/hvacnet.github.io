<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
