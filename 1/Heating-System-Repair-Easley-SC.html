<p>In some cases, however, developing occupants experience signs that do not fit the pattern of any particular illness and are challenging to trace to any specific phenomenon has actually been labeled sick structure syndrome. People may suffer one or more of the following signs: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; stuffy or runny nose; fatigue or lethargy; headache; dizziness; queasiness; irritation and lapse of memory. Poor lighting, noise, vibration, thermal pain, and mental stress may also cause, or contribute to, these symptoms.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is generally more costly than central air.<p>
