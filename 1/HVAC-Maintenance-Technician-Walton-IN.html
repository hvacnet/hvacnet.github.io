<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
