<p>Customer items that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to trigger cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide in the body and can trigger symptoms associated with exposure to carbon monoxide gas.

When possible; usage indoors just if the area is well ventilated, usage products that contain methylene chloride outdoors.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher.

<p>Air toxins can vary from impurities generated from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leakages.

Older houses may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are generally greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may choose to replace the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system if you do so. Nevertheless, thinking about current changes in refrigerants and a/c styles, it might be wiser to change the whole system.<p>
