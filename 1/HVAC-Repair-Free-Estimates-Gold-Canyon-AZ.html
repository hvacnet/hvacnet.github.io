<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
