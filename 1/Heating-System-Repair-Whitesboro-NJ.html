<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
