He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to find a sincere AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
