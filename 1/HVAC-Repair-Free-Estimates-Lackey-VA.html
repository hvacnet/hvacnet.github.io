<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that immunity differs considerably from individual to private, it is not practical to develop a universal standard fit for all in terms of direct exposure and health.

The structure type included both commercial and residential. Most of samples analyzed were checked favorable for fungis and germs.<p>
