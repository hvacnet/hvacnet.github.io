<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractors in West Chicago</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Our indoor air quality experts can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center.

The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems also help control germs and organic odors. Many store-bought filters can not get rid of these tiniest of irritants and don't get rid of gases and bacteria.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
