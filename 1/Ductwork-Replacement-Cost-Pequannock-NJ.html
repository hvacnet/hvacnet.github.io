<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
