<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have numerous control boards. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
