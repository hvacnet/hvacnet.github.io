<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
