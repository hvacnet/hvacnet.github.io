Porous products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and ought to be disposed of. Often there is a moldy odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in concealed or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
