<p>UW students, employees and visitors should have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform different activities. If the air quality is poor it can affect an individual's efficiency, health, and convenience.  The purpose of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to provide and maintain healthy and comfy environments without pollutants. A key part of the program is reacting to and solving concerns of building residents about problems in their work environment.<p>
<p>Together with these weather changes, we have actually likewise been the country's fastest growing city over the last decade, including well over 100,000 people, or a growth of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In most areas of our nation, a/c is a basic requirement, meaning the people that move here from out of state are most likely expecting to have a/c. Likewise, real estate prices in Seattle have actually increased, and as a result, more recent homes are getting taller and skinnier, with bed rooms on the upper levels. Many attics are also being converted to complete bed rooms to include additional space. Spaces in the upper locations of homes are specifically susceptible to getting very hot and uncomfortable throughout the summer season, making a/c a lot more necessary.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that perfect temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service strategy which usually consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
