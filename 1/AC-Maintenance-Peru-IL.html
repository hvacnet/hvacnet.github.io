<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
<p>No matter the type of electric radiant flooring heating unit, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or modified. Any disturbance or disruption in the flow of electrical power makes the system unusable. This is among the drawbacks to setting up an electric radiant heat system. However, assuming they are installed properly and effectively looked after, the probability of them having issues is little.<p>
