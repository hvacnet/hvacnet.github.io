<h3>Installation of HVAC in South River NJ</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
