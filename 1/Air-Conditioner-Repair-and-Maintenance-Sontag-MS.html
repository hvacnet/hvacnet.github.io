<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes.
