<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electricity, a heatpump is a cost-efficient solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>Rising energy costs are not the only reason for high bills. Furnaces frequently lose their efficiency as they age, specifically if they have not been appropriately kept. As a result your oil or natural gas furnace might run longer to supply the exact same quantity of heat. This will trigger your energy bills to increase. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies monthly might be used to help you spend for a new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating costs with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a significant difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>
