<p>A specific ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic a/c in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path.

The air was cooled, and therefore the amount of wetness in the air could be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the space controllable. The regulated temperature level and humidity helped maintain constant paper measurements and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was used to increase productivity in the work environment, and The Provider Air Conditioning Company of America was formed to satisfy rising need. With time, cooling came to be used to improve comfort in houses and autos also.<p>
