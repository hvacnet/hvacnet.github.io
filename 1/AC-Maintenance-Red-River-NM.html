<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
