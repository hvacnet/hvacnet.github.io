<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
