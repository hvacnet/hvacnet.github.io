<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the unit.

Part of preserving your furnace includes examining the suggested connections in addition to temperature level and pressure evaluates. Take some time to check these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are protected and tight.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
