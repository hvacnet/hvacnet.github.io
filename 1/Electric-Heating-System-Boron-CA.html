<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others.

Heating systems that kick on regularly may be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
