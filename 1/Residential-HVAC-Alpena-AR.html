They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time.

I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
