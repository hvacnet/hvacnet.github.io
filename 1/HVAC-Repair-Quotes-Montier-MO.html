<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, because it takes into account not only the small power of the units, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards usually total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial cost of a system competitive with standard equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them..
