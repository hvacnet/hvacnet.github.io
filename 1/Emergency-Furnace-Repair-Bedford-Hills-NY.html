<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
