Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But a lot of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne impurities in their houses and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>

<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air.
