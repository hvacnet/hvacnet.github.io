<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
