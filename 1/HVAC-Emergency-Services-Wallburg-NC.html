<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
