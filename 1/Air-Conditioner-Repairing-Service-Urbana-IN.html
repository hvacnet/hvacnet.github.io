<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
