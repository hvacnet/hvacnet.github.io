<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.

Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area, stale air might also be a problem.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that provide gas to your furnace must also be checked routinely. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire danger.

It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
