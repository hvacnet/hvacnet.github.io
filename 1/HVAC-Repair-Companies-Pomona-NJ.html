Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
