<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
