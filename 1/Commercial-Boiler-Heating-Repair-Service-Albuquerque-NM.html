<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

They weren't cheap but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
