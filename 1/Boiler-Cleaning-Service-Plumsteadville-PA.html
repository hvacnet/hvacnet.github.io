<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Toxins could come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below. An air toxin could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and bacteria, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
