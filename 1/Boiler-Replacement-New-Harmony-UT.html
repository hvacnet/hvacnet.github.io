<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has a possibility to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
