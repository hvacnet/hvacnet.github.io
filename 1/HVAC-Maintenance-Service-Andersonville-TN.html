<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
