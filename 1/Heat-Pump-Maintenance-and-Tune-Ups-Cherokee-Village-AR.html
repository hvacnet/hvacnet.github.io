<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>When installing radiant heat, you must give severe thought to the type of floor covering in the house. Ceramic tile works well due to the fact that it performs and shops heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work reasonably well. Carpets will directly insulate the flooring from the space, reducing effectiveness, so if you wish to set up carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with thick cushioning.<p>
<p>Selecting the best size central air system for your home is really important, as is selecting either a package system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one system, or a split system, which puts the condenser outside the home and the fan and coil within. Proper placement is also important to ensure proper and uniform cooling. The pros at All Points Heating make sure you make all the right options for your house.<p>
