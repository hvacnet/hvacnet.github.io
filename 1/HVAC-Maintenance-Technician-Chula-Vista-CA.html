While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
