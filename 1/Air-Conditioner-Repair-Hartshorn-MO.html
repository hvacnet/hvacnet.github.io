<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
