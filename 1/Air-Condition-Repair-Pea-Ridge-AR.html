The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.
