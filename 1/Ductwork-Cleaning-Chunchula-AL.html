<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room.

The Policy prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
