<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My other half said that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have actually met in a very long time.

The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
