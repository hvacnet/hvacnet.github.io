<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at Martinsville IN</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
