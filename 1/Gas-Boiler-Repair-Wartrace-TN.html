<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
