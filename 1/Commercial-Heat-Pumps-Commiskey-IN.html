<h3>AC Duct Repair in Commiskey IN</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it!
