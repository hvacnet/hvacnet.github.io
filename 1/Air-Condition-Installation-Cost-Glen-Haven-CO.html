<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
