<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead.
