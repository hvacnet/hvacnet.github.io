<h3>Central Heating Repair in Lakewood CA</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for years for my companies, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
