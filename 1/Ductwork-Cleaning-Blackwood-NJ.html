<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Blackwood NJ Home</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Blackwood NJ</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to evaluate scenario & decided to opt for them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked with from beginning to end were very professional, considerate and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those measurements on hand when purchasing an ac system to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window. Likewise, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to install the a/c: Do not place it in an egress window that functions as the only ways of escape need to a fire emerge.<p>
