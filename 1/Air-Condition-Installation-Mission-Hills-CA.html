<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, try to find indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your house might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To find smells in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
