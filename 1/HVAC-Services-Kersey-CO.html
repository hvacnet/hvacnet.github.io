<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Only a specialist can precisely diagnose why your furnace isn't starting. It's time to call an expert if at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something appears unusual or you lose self-confidence. Similarly, if the process doesn't work, something else is incorrect and you require a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you have to do it frequently, it's most likely time for a professional opinion.<p>
