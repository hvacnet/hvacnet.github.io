Radiant heating, for example, may be a better fit for your requirements.<p>

When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
