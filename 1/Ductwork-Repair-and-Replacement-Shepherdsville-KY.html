For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  a very helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
