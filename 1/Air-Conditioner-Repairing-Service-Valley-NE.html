This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
