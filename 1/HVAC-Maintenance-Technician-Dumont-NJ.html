<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues before we supply advice to replace rather than repair a heater. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
