<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Service in West Harrison</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their total power ought to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not basic, considering that it takes into account not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
