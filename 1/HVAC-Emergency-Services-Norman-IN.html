<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
