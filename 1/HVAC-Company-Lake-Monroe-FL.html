<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Lake Monroe FL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
