<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide need to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
