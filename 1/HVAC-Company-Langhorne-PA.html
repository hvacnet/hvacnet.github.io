The EPA research study recommended and controlled methods used on a smaller sized variety of houses.

<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Langhorne PA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
