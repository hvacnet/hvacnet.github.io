<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Energy performance can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room a/c supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
