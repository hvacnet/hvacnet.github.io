<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
