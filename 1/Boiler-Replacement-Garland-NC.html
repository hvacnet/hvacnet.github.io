<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
