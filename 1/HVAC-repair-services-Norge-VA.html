<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
