<p>My oldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time fixing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
