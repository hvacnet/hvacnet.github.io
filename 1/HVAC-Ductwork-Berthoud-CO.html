<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
