<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Gladeville TN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
