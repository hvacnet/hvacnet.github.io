<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills all of a sudden appear greater than typical, it is probably time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is much more effective-- you'll see lower fuel expenses immediately, not to discuss the money you'll save money on repair costs. If your heater is 25 years old or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel costs in half.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than models made even 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your system if it's five years old or older. The very best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while delivering the same amount of cooling.<p>
