<p>Because an ac system moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to regularly clean the condenser coil.

<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
