<p>Particular immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently difficult to identify if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is very important to focus on the time and location symptoms happen. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is far from the area, for example, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>Because an ac system moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
