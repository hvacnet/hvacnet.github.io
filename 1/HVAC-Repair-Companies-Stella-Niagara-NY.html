<p>Intensifying the noted health signs might be task tension. In part, due to different aspects of workplace automation, the most difficult elements of office work are increasing. Health signs associated with job stress consist of physical and mental pressures such as disappointment, stress and anxiety, irritability, anger, anxiety, stomach or gastro-intestinal disturbances, and muscle and psychological tension. These symptoms might be promoted by bad indoor quality.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might see musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
