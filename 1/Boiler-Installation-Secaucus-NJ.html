<p>Expert heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts suggest following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
