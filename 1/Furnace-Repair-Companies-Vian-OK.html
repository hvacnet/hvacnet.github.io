<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
