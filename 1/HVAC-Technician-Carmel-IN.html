<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer.

<h3>Maximizing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System in Carmel IN</h3>

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
