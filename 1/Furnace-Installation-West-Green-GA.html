<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
