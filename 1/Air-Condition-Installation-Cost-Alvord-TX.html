<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is very effective and beneficial, specifically throughout the Summer while the system acts to cool one's house.
