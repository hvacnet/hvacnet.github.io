<p>There are 2 primary kinds of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to resist present, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements entirely by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working, integrity Energy was quick to react. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heating systems can heat your house. Honestly, our home heating unit is complicated, Rob and his team repaired the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
