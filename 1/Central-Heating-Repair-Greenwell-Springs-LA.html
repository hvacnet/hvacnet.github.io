<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
