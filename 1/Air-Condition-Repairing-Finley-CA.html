Load calculating is described as the Handbook J computation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for a/c. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based upon experience or on square video alone, transfer to another contractor.

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in gathering information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
