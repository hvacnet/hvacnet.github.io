These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
