<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works however your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Buildings are developed or meant to respond actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

We might find it helpful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, specifically, a few of the methods utilized by researchers studying ecosystems, in order to acquire a boosted understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our buildings.<p>
