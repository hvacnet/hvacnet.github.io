<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
