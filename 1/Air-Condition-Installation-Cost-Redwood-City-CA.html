<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name.

<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings construct up indoors.<p>

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>

I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
