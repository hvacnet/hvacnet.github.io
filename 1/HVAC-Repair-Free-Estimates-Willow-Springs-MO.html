<p>Specialist heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC experts suggest following this standard guideline when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy new.
