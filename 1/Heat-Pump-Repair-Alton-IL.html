<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them again. Switch off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
