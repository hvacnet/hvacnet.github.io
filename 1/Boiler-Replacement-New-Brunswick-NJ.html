<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
