As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
