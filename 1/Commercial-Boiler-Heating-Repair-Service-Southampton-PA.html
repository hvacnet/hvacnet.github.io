<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
