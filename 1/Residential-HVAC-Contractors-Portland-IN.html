<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in collecting information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
