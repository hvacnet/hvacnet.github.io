<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils.

It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
