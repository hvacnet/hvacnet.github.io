If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
