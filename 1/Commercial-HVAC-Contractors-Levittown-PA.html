<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
