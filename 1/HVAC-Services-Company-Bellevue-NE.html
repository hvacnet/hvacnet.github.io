<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>

Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly might end up being blocked, minimizing air flow volume, distribution, and quality.
