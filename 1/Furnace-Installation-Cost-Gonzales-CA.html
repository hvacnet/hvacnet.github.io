However, choose your contractor carefully, many of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
