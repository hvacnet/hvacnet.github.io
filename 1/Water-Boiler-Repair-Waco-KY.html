<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy.
