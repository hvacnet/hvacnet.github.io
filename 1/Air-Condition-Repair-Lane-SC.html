<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing in Lane SC</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We picked getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater because the technicians thought they just didn't seem right and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
