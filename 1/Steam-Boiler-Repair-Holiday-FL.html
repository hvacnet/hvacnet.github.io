<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
