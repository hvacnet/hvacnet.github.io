And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is simple to set up, particularly if you make it part of a construct or restoration job.

Plus, there's even an added cleaning convenience as keeping the rooms dust-free is simpler without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
