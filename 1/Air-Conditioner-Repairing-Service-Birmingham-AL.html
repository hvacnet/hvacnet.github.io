<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your company needs to inspect measurements of humidity, air and temperature flow. In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to make certain it is working according to specs for developing usage and occupancy) must be carried out. A building walk-through to check for smells and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings might be practical. Leakages need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become infected with fungi or germs and need to be gotten rid of, likewise.

For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
