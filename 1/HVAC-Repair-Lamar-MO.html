<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil.

Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
