This is generally used in a 2nd or third-floor  area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
