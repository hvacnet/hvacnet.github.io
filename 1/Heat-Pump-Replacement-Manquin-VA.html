Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year.
