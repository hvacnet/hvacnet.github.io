<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

Firstly, the direction of air circulation from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Second of all, there ought to not be any challenges on the way of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible.
