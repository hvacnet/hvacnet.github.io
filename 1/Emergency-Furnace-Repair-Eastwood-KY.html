<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
