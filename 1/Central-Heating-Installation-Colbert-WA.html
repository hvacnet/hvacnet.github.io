<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
