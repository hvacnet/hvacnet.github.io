<p>Sean was very practical. He is a very pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
