<p>Expert heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate.

Finally found someone to correctly service and the unit has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
