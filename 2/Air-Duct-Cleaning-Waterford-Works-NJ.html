<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the unit has been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
