<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
