These combustion products may result in nose, throat, and eye irritation; fatigue; lightheadedness; and queasiness.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the exact same indoor air issues as single-family homes because a lot of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure products, home furnishings, and home items, are comparable.
