<p>. Before choosing the installation location of air conditioning system, a number of main aspects require to be considered. To start with, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor units need to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there need to not be any challenges on the way of the air flow that may prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor system must likewise be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be efficiently discharged outside and the performance of the entire system will drop sharply. It is extremely advisable to set up the air conditioner units in easily available places, for more maintenance during operation.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
