<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them up until they have actually been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
