These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
