<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working.
