<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
