<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
