<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
