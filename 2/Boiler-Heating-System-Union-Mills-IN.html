<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
