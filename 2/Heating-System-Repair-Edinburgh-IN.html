<p>There are two primary kinds of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are required to withstand current, which then generates heat.<p>
