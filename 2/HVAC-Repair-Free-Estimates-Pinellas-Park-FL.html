<p>Prior to you head out and purchase an ac system, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be installing the a/c? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning unit be? Too large and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c will not be able to cool your house correctly.

If the existing system has actually not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and remedied, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
