<p>Airborne irritants are simply a fact of life. Molds can trigger flare-ups of allergic reaction symptoms, and in some cases, trigger asthma attacks. Germs, viruses, and germs also can reside in the air you breathe every day. These air-borne pollutants can impact your home comfort devices, too. Permitted to distribute through your home and your system, these and other particles can develop on the indoor coil, preventing air flow and decreasing heating and cooling effectiveness. By using the product or services we offer, you can lower and frequently eliminate these unwanted air-borne toxins from your home, leaving clean air and safe surfaces throughout your household.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
