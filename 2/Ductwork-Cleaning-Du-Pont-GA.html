<h3>Central Heating Repair in Du Pont GA</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>First of all, The after hours addressing service representative, John, was very courteous and expert. Secondly, Gracion W is a timely, well-informed technician. He was at my home within the time he gave me, repaired the problem while describing the problem then remained a number of minutes to make sure it was working properly. The concern was fixed in a matter of time that I've never ever seen before while being a homeowner for 10 years. I also recommend one of the Defense Strategies, which I belong to, if you like to save cash. Thank you." Karen P.<p>
