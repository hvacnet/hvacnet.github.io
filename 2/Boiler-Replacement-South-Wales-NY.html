<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
