<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
