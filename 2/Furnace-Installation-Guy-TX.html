<h3>Home AC Repair in Guy TX</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is traditionally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice in between the 2 types. Gas heating systems cost about the exact same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The genuine advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
