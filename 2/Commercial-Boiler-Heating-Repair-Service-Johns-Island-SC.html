<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health effects discussed. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily real that the effects noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels generally found in the home. In most cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed effects could occur.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat allergen could cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
