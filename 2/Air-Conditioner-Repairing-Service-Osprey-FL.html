<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
