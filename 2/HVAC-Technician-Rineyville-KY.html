<p>Filters can get filthy easily, particularly if you reside in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed routinely, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you expect it to.
