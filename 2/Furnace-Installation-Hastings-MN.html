I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.
