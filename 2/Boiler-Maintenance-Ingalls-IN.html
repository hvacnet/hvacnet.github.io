Furthermore, considering that they do not trust fans, ducts, returns and signs up to disperse hot air, in-floor heating systems can lower the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as constructing products, furnishings, and home items like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less constantly. Other sources, associated to activities carried out in the home, release pollutants periodically.

High contaminant concentrations can remain in the air for long periods after a few of these activities.<p>
