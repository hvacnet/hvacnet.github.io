<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently may be because of a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
