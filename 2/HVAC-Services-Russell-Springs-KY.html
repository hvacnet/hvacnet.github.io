<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
