<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Wauna WA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to order it. My partner said that she had seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have satisfied in a very long time. If we want to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine people who are there for us. Please do.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
