Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outside sources, including infected soil tracked inside, and use of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
