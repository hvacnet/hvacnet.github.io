<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
