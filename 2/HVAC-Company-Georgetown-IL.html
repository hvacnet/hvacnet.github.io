<p>If no pollutant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area, stagnant air may also be an issue.<p>
<p>Radiant heat includes setting up coils or pipes in the floor, offering heat from listed below and moving up. It provides an even, general heat temperature level throughout the space. With no moving parts, it's comfortable and very quiet, and it doesn't stimulate as much dust and allergens, as compared to forced-air systems. It likewise doesn't create any drafts, and getting rid of the requirement to blow air makes it more energy effective.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works however your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
