<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing material purchased with your house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes.

<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor.
