<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
