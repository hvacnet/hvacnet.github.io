Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
