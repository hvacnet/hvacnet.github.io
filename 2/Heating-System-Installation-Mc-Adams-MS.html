<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that gathers during summer seasons. The very best thing to do is making certain that the heating unit burners are inspected and cleaned up completely prior to cooler seasons start. Constantly be sure that the furnace is tidied up each year to avoid soot and condensation which triggers burners to stop working appropriately. If your furnace is in an extremely poor condition, possibly it is time to begin considering buying a brand-new one.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
