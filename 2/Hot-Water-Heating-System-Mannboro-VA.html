<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>My eldest boy constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
