<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in location. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the outcome of recurring use of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, causing fractures and holes. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. a very beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
