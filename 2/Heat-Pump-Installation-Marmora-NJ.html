<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC.
