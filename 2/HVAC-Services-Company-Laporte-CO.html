<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
