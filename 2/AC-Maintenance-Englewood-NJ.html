<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in effectiveness advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because a system is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
