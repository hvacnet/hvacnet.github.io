<p>Most people don't know how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier.

<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity.

<p>I typically do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
