<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
