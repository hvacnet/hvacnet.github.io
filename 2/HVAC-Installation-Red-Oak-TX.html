<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>

Briefly increasing ventilation paired with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be useful in watering down the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
