<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
