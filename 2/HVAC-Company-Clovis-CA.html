<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
