<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
