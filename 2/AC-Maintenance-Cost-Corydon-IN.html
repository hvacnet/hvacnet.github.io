Our knowledgeable group brings more than two decades of HVAC setups to provide innovative solutions that fit your job completely.

<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant arising from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are generally greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new houses are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home. Some of these styles consist of energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers). To find out more about air-to-air heat exchangers, get in touch with the Preservation and Renewable Resource Inquiry and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
