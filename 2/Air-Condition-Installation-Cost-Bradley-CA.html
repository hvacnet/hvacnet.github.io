<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Bradley CA Home</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need relatively little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be looked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed occasionally to eliminate tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems need to be inspected a minimum of two times per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed periodically to remove dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean the condenser coil.
