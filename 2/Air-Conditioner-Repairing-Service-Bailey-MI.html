Convected heat systems have actually been around considering that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a warm water supply.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
