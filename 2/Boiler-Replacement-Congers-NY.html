<p>Details provided in this safety guide is based upon existing clinical and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not require you to change your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your home's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to 20 years.

<p>Radiant heating provides a number of distinct advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not have to stress over duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of up to 30% in other heater types. Transferring heat through solid items will likewise cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home warmed by a radiant system will warm up quicker, and remain warm with less energy invested. These are simply a few of the many benefits that a radiant heating system can provide you.<p>
