<p>This evaluation is for replacing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who explained our choices did an excellent task in making certain we comprehended the pros and cons of each option. The technicians who installed the brand-new system were fast and expert, while taking some time to make certain we understood how the new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
