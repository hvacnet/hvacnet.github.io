<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from items or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Often a momentary indoor air quality issue is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more intricate issues-- recognized by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods listed below might be appropriate.<p>
