<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
