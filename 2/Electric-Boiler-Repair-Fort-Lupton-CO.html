<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
