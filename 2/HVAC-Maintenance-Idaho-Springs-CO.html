<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
