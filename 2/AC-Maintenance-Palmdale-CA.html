<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
