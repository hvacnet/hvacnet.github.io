Likewise, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can trigger symptoms related to direct exposure to carbon monoxide. Thoroughly check out the labels consisting of health hazard details and warns on the appropriate use of these products. When possible; usage inside just if the location is well ventilated, use items that contain methylene chloride outdoors.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.
