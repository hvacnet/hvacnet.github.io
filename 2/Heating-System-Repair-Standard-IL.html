<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies.

However, a lot of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
