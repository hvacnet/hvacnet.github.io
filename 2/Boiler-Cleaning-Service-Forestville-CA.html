<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
