<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
