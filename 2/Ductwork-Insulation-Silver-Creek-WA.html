The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in over half the work environment indoor air examinations it has actually carried out.

These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
