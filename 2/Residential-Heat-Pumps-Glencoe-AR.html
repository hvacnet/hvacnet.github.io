POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect. A lot of ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every single unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
