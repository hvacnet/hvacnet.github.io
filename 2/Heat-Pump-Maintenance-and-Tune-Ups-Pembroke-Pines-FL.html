The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils.

It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily incorporated with existing systems such as standard forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be installed in a new building.
