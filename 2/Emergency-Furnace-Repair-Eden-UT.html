<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
