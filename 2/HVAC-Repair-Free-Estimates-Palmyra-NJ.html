<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who works in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used all over the world, including EMV. He's said several times that the distinct code function is numerous and optional, numerous retailers don't utilize it due to the fact that it slows down transactions even more due to the back-and-forth interactions needed. I don't understand sufficient about the technology to understand if that is even possible.<p>
<p>We're spending a lot more time indoors, these days. While many people assume pollution is just an outside issue, your house (and workplace) can also be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, however we don't think adequate about exposure to all the important things we put in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- right away, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<p>Because they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Ac system Leaks Water, below.<p>
