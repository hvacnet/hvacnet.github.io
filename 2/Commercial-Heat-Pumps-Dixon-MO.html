<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold development and need to be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in concealed or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the location utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
