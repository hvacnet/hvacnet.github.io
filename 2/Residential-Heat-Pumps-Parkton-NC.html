<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators employed hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928.

<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Parkton NC</h3>
<p>Many people underestimate the extent of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is typically imagined as the black smoke emitted from factories. Little thought is provided to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, paints, and pesticides used in the house.

As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we do not believe adequate about direct exposure to all the things we place in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

<h3>Determining Heat Vacuum Cleaners in Parkton NC</h3>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
