<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Nixa MO</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance.

No additional charge.<p>
