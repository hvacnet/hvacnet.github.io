<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been used frequently in a range of structure construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have actually prohibited numerous asbestos products. Makers have also willingly restricted usages of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most frequently found in older houses, in pipe and furnace insulation products, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other covering materials, and flooring tiles.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the centers managers who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service pertained to us for that reason. More often than not they were at first thinking about remotely keeping track of some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't until later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they found out about and implemented indoor air quality monitoring to provide a much healthier, much safer building environment-- and to head off the unfavorable repercussions related to indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
