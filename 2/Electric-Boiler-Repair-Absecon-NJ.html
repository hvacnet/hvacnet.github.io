<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
