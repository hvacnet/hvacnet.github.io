The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
