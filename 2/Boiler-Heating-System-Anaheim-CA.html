<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Your AC installer will understand what to look for.<p>
