<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
