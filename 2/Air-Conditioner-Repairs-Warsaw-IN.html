<h3>Best Portable Air Conditioner in Warsaw IN</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas heating systems While oil is typically utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option between the 2 types. Gas heating systems cost about the very same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
