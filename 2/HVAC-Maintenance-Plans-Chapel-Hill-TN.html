<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon ends up being caught in structures and concentrations develop up inside.<p>

<p>Structures are created or intended to respond actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and preserve surfaces to enhance their longevity, efficiency, or look. In other cases, such changes discreetly and even dramatically alter structures in ways that may be necessary to their own stability or their influence on building residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time. We may find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, a few of the techniques utilized by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to get a boosted understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A great place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one component (out of numerous) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
