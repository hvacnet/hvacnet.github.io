<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a few years back.<p>

Search for the ENERGY STAR Â® and EnergyGuide labels - certified central systems are about 15% more efficient than standard designs. New residential central air conditioning conditioner requirements entered into result on January 1, 2015; see the performance requirements for central air conditioners for information, and consider acquiring a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for greater cost savings.<p>
