<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
