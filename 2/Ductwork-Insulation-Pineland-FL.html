<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores circulating through your house. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is essential to be familiar with some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be prowling in your environments.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, however many utilize the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better solution. If the existing system has not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be determined and corrected, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
