<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
