<p>Today's home convected heat systems maximize infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a home is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally located in one location like a restroom flooring or be installed throughout the whole sub-surface of the home's floors. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
