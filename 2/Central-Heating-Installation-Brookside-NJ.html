<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent seldom or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
