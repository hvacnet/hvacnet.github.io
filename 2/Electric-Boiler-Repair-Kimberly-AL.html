You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.
