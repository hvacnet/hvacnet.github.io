<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
