<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
