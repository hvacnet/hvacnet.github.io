<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be polluted (since of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread out these toxins throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread out pollutants from one part of the house to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can help reduce these problems.<p>
