<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
