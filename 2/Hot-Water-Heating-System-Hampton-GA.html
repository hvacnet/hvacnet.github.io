Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in collecting info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
