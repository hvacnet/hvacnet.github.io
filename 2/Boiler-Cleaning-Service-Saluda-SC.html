<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Oil heating systems are usually not extremely effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not achieve a performance higher than 90%. A few high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation too because a drain needs to be installed.<p>
<p>Typically the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions.
