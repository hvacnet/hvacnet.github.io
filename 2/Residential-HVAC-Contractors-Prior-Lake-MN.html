<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators used flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed just a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>Specific types of HVAC systems are a little bit more costly than wall units, ceiling or cassette units are nicely concealed inside the ceiling in the classroom and are for that reason more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to look at.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
