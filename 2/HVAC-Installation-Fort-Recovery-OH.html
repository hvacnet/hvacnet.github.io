PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While room a/c provides maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
