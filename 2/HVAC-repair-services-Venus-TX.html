<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have numerous control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the new control board should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
