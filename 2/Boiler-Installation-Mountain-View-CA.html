(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.
