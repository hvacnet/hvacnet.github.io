<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large merchant who asked not to be named because he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that consistently keeps an eye on energy usage and temperatures in shops to minimize expenses (particularly at night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the stores change outside of an appropriate range that might prevent customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate.
