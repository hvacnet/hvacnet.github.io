<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
