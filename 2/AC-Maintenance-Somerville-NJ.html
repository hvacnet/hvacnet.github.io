<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
