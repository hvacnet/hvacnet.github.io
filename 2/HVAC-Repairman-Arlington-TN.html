<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is truthful, reliable, and affordable on price. It's tough to discover a sincere AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
