<p>Let's start by laying out the preparation that needs to take place before you in fact purchase a furnace. Picking a furnace for your house isn't as simple as selecting one off a showroom floor. Not all furnaces are good for all homes, and there are a couple of factors that absolutely need to be thought about before picking one.

Atmospheric pressure distinctions produced by these forces move airborne pollutants from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the within pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>
