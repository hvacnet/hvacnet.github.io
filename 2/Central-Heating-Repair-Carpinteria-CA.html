<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively treat and harden-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
