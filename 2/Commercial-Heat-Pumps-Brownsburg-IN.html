<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Brownsburg IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
