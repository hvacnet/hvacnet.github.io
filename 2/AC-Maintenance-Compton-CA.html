<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Compton CA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare celebrations.<p>
