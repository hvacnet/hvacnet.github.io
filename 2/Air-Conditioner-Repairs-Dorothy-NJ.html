<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that gathers throughout summers. The best thing to do is making sure that the heater burners are examined and cleaned up completely prior to cooler seasons begin. Constantly be sure that the furnace is cleaned up yearly to prevent soot and condensation which triggers burners to quit working correctly. Perhaps it is time to begin thinking about buying a new one if your furnace is in an extremely bad condition.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>
