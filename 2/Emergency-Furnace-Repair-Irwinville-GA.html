In selecting a furnace, property owners need to consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>We called Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to evaluate scenario & decided to choose them for the work.
