<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to buy it. My other half said that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good people I have fulfilled in a long period of time.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
