The reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers.
