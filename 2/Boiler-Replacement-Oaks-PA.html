<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
