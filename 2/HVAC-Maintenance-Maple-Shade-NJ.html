<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
