<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power should not go beyond the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
