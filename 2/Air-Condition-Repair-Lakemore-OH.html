<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
