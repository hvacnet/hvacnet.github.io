<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the unit has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
