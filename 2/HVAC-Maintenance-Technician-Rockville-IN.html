<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be set up to offer threshold signals. If, for example, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your tracking equipment to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the proper action to deal with the situation immediately.<p>
