<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.

When radon ends up being trapped in structures and concentrations build up inside your home, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has actually been used typically in a range of building construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant.

<p>We're investing a lot more time indoors, these days. While lots of people presume contamination is simply an outdoor problem, your house (and office) can likewise be polluted. As a society, we make certain that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, however we do not believe enough about direct exposure to all the things we put in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- immediately, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely specify the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that ought to be constantly supplied in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be useful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
