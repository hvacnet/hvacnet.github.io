<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is frequently difficult to quantify, as one response specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repetitive use of a component that runs out balance.

If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.  an extremely useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
