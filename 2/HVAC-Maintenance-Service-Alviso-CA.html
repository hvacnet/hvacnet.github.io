For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness inside your home is associated with a higher occurrence of occupant breathing problems.<p>
