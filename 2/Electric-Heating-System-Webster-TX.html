<p>Specialist heating unit setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists advise following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a conventional forced air heater.

Required air heating systems tend to suffer from things like duct leaks, which rob them of approximately 30% of their output. Forced air heating unit also tend to generate hot and cold areas throughout the house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>
