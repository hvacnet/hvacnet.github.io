Many common structure materials used before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation.

A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is frequently advised instead.<p>
