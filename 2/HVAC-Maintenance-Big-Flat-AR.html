<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate because it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
