<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Shut off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2).

<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic duty provision" applies.
