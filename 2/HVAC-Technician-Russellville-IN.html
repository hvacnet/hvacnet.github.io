<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, work environments and schools matters, particularly since we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just radiant systems.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>
