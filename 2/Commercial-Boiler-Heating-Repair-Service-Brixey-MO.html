<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
