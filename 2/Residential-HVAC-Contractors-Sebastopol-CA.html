<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
