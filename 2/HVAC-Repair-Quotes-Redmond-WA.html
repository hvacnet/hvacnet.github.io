<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur in time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems.
