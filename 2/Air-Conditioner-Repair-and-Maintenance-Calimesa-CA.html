<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can afford, many Seattleites must discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the reality of a vicious, vicious summer.<p>
