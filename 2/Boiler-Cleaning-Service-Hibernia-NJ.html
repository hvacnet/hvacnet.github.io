<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
