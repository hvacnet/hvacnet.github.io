<p>Indoor air contamination is brought on by burning solid fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can differ substantially from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance task might require absolutely various actions and procedures than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being examined.

<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator.
