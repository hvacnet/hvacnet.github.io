<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
