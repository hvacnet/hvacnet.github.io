<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the house. Toxins might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and infections, animal dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
