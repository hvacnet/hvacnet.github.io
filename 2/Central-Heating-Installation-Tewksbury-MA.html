<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
