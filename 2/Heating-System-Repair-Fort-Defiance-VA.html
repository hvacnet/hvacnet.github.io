<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
