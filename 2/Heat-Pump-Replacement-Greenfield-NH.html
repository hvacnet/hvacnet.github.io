<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for lowering the air quality in your home, but there are many other contaminants that can not just unclean up the air, however lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure products contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some sort of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
