<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
