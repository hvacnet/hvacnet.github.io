If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable environment, or simply a high level of competitors for competent trades.

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
