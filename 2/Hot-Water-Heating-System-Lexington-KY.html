<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
