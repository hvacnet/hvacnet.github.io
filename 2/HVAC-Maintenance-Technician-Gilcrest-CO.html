Place control involves moving the toxin source far from occupants or even transferring susceptible residents.<p>
<p>Some health results may show up quickly after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a contaminant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are treatable and normally short-term.
