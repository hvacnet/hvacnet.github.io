<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Stilwell KS Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>In the last numerous years, a growing body of clinical evidence has suggested that the air within houses and other structures can be more seriously contaminated than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research shows that individuals spend roughly 90 percent of their time indoors. Therefore, for many individuals, the threats to health might be higher due to direct exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
