<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Griffin GA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require fairly little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is necessary to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be looked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in tough water areas). The systems must be inspected at least two times each year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
