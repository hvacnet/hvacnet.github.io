<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
