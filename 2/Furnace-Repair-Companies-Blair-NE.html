You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as just one aspect (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
