<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
