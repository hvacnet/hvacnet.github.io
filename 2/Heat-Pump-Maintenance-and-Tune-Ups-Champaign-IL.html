<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for house owners to consider. Many times, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally just available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best option for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
