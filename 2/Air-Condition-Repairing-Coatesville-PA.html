<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and allowing greater comfort at greater temperatures.<p>
