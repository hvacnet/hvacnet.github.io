<p>Employers are needed to follow the General Responsibility Clause of the OSHAct, which requires them to supply workers with a safe workplace that does not have any recognized risks that cause or are likely to cause death or severe injury. The OSHAct also needs companies to comply with occupational security and health standards produced under it.

It is also their responsibility to inform staff members of the instant dangers that are present.Specific state and local guidelines may use.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
