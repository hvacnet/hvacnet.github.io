<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install evaluation outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
