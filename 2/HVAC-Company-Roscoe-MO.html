<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
