<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your ac system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Merely adding refrigerant is not a service if it leakages.

<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems in Walton KY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his examination, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
