<p>Measurement treatments are being established and shown to examine building ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These procedures vary from sophisticated tracer gas techniques used predominantly in constructing research efforts to less involved treatments that can be used by constructing operators. NIST researchers are continually developing new test treatments, and after that showing them in the field to examine their feasibility and dependability. The efforts in which these procedures are shown in the field has led to the development of an important database of building ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Immediate effects may show up after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are treatable and normally short-term. In some cases the treatment is simply getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also appear soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant arising from gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
