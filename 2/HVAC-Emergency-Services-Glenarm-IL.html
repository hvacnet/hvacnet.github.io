<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>

The EPA study recommended and controlled techniques used on a smaller sized number of houses.

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future.
