(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
