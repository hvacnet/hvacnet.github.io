<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
