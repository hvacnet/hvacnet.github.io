The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
