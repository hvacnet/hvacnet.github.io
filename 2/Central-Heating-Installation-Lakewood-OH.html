<p>If you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your house, plan on investing several thousand dollars for the total system. The size of the system identifies the labor hours included to build the system. To equip a house with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand name brand-new furnace or more when you think about installation charges upwards of $50 per hour.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities.
