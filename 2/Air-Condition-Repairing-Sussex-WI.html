<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While space cooling offers optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
