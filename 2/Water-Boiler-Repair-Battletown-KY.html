<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has ended up being an important problem to property owners and health experts. Indoor air contamination research studies have identified a number of impurities that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these pollutants are necessary in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

For instance, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on routine sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, however rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot.

<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
