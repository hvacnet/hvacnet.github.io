<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, instead of outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
