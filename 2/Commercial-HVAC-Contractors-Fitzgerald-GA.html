<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>
