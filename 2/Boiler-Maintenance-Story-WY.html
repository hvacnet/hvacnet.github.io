<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
