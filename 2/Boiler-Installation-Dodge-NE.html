<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<h3>Choosing the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems in Dodge NE</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
