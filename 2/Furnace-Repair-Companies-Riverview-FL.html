<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood items used adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor usage include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).
