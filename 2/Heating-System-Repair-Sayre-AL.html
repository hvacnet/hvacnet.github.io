<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
