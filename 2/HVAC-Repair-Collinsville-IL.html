<h3>Electric Furnace in Collinsville IL</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
