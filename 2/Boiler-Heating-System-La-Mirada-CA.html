<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Residential systems can further improve indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and area rugs.<p>
<p>Some health results might show up quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a pollutant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are treatable and generally short-term. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.
