<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Belmont CA</h3>

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
