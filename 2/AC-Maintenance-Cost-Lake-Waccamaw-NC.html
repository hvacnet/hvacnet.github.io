<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use.

Heating systems that kick on regularly might be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
