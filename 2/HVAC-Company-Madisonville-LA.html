<p>The properties and composition of the soil in a location can affect the rate at which heat is performed through the ground. These must be taken into consideration before picking the best design of an underground heating and cooling system. Soil with favorable heat transfer residential or commercial properties needs fewer pipelines to attain the desired underground cooling and heating impact, while those with decreased thermal conductivity will require more pipelines.<p>
<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
