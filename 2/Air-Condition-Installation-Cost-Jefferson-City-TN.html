<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event.

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
