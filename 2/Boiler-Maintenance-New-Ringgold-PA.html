<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heat pump While space a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
