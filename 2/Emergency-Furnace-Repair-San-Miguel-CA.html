<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
