<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
