<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is typically tough to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  an extremely helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
