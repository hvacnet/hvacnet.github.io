<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are good that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Central air units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
