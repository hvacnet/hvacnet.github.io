Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>When setting up radiant heating, you should offer serious thought to the kind of flooring covering in the house. Due to the fact that it performs and stores heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, but work reasonably well. Carpets will directly insulate the floor from the room, decreasing performance, so if you wish to set up carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with dense cushioning.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely specify the amount (and often quality) of outside air that need to be continually provided in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation combined with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
