<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
