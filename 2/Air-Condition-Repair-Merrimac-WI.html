<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
