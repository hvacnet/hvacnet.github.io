<p>My eldest son constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
