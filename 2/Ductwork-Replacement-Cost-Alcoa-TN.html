<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>AC Maintenance in Alcoa TN</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
