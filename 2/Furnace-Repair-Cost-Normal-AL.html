<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Normal AL</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
