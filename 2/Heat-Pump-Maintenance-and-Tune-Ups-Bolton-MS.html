Pressed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is usually recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely practical in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
