<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Benson NC</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
