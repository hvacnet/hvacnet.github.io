<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
