HVAC professionals advise following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a new system, it's finest to purchase new.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>
