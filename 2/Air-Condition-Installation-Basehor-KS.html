<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Basehor KS</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
