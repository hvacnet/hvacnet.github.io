<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
