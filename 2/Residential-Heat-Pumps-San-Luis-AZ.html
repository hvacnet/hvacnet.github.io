<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's potentially costly to set up, specifically in an older house. Depending on the type of system set up, it can be loud and trigger problems if you're extremely adverse dust. Furthermore, certain fuels and devices may need special licenses, and there is limited flexibility in case of changed heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, ceiling, wall, and floor coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold development and must be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in concealed or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
