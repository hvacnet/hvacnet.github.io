<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and houses matters, especially considering that we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely humid environments or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the ac system will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a conventional forced air heater. Radiant heating systems tend to be much more energy effective than other heaters, for one thing. Required air heating systems tend to suffer from things like duct leakages, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output. Required air heating unit also tend to produce hot and cold areas throughout the house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a room and sinks as it cools.<p>

Setting up a new geothermal heat pump to deal with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>
