<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

Individuals at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
