"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
