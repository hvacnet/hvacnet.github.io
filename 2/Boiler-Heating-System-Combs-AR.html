<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
