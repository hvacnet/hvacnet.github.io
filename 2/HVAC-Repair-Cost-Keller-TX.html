<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
