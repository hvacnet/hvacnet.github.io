Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I seem like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
