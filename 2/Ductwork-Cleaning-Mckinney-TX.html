They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to purchase it. My other half stated that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent individuals I have actually satisfied in a long period of time.
