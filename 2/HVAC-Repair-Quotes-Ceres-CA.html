<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
