<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
