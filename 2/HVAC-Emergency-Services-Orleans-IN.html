<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually.
