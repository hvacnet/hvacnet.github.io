<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a reliable and simple approach to reduce ambient air pollution and potential health threats, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Usually the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more affordable method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
