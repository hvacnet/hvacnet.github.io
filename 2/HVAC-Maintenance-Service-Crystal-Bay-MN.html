<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
