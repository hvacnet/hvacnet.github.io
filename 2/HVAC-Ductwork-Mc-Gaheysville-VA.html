<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
