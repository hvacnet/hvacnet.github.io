<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
