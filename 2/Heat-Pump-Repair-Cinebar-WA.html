<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a variety of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has identified building materials, home furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, but much of the danger also originates from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially huge concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These products provide a risk just when they are managed in such a way that creates dust including asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being air-borne if correct controls are not in location. This can result in the potential for significant health issue.<p>
