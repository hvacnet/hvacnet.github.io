Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that protect your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.

There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on rare occasions.<p>
