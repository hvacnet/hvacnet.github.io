Such a tool should determine the variety of individuals affected; define ages and job descriptions of involved employees; figure out where they are located within the office; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of particular health symptoms or diseases; determine all machines operated in the office; show the type of outside air contamination; and identify possible sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
