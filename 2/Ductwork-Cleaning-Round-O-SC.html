<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
