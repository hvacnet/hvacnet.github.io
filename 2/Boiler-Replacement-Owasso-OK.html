<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
