<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires handled by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution.

Germs or micro-organisms may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the entire workplace or building by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
