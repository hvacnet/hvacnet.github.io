<h2>How To Hire HVAC Services in Cape Coral</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
