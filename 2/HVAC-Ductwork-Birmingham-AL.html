<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Birmingham</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
