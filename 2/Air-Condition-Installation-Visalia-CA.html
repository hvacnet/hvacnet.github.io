<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature level.

Try to keep your children from consuming dirt, and ensure they clean their hands when they come inside.<p>
