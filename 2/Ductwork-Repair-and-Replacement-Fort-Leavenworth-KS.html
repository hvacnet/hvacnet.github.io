<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
