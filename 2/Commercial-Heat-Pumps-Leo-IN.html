<h3>How to Choose a Specialist HVAC Tech in Leo IN</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of changing or exchanging air in any area to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>

<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be efficiently identified or remedied without an extensive structure examination.
