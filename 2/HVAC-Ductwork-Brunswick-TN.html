More major than most allergenic homes is the capability of mold to trigger episodes personallies that currently have asthma, a severe respiratory illness.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most affordable. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
