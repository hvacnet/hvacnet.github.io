Such a tool should recognize the variety of people impacted; specify ages and job descriptions of involved employees; determine where they are located within the office; indicate when the symptoms take place (time of day, day of week, and time of year); offer a list of particular health signs or health problems; recognize all makers run in the office; show the kind of outdoors air pollution; and determine potential sources of task tension.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater.

And practically 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
