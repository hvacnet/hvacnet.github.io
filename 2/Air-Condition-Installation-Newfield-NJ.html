<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
