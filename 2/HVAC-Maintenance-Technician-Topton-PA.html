<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.
