<p>Today's home convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a home is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally situated in one location like a bathroom floor or be installed across the entire sub-surface of the home's floorings. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
