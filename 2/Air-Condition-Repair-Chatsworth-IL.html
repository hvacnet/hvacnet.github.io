<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Chatsworth IL</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the air conditioning unit before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
