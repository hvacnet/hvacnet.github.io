<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably simple to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants emitted by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high indoors may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings.

<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly decreases direct exposure to pollutants during cooking. Improper adjustment, often shown by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a brand-new gas stove or range. Never ever use a gas range to heat your home. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
