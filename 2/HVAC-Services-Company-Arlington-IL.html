<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by the majority of public water supplies, it has actually been discovered in well water. If you've checked the air in your house and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a lab accredited to measure radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon problems in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and efficiency if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one significant downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
