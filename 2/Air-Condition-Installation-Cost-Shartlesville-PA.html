<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal components as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling several spaces at the same time, but are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more cash on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
