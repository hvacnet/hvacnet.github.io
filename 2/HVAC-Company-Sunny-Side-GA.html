<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Sunny Side GA</h3>
<p>Sean was really helpful. He is an extremely pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC technicians. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>
