<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
