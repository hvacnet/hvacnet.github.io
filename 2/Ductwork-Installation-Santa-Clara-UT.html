<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
