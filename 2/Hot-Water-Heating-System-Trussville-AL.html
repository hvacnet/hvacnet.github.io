Heaters that kick on regularly may be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
