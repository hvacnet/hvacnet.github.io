<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips.

Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
