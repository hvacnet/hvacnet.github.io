"Humidifier fever" is a typical illness caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Numerous fungis and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the structure residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and home plants.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as constructing products, furnishings, and household products like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less continually. Other sources, associated to activities performed in the home, release toxins intermittently. These include smoking cigarettes, the use of malfunction-ing or unvented stoves, heaters, or area heating units, using solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, the use of paint strippers in remodeling activities, and using cleaning items and pesticides in house cleaning.
