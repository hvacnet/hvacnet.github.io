<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
