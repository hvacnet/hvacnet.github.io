<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly gotten rid of from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can likewise arise from lead dust from outside sources, consisting of contaminated soil tracked inside, and use of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the unit or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
