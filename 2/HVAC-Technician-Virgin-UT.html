<h3>HVAC Companies in Virgin UT</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
