The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
