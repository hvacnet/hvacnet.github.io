<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
