<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
