<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Cotati CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
