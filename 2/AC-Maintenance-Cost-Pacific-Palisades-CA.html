<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Pacific Palisades CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
