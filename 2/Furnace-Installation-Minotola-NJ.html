<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate scenario & chose to choose them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air going however likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked to from starting to end were very expert, courteous and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A good location to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one component (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that ideal temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which generally includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
