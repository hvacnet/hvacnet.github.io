<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have actually been correctly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
