<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>For instance, pollutants might collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outside toxin, it may act as a pathway to bring the impurities inside.
