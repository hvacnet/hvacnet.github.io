<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other work environments is important not only for employees' comfort but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been connected to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, problem concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some specific diseases have been connected to specific air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate symptoms but can lead to cancer after many years.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down totally. By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can typically be performed in just a few minutes, typically without any tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
