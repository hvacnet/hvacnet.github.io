<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Converse IN</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
