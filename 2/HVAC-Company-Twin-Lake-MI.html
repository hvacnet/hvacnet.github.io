<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with your home. This company presented a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the inspection on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health risk reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new property owner I have actually learned how to determine the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor toxins discharged by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors might trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
