<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>A hydronic heating system, otherwise known as radiant heating, can help you save cash. The system is particularly economical for off-the-grid houses and homes in locations with pricey electricity. The system uses different energy sources; it can count on standard gas- or oil-fired boilers, wood-fired boilers, solar water heaters, or any mix of these systems. The system operates in an energy-efficient way, and will minimize expenditures monthly.<p>
