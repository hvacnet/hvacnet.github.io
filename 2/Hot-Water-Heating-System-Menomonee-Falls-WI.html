<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
