Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Truth All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Moore SC</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based just on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many people.<p>

<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise an alternative for property owners to consider. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
