You can usually conclude that the capacitor has failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't believe enough about direct exposure to all the things we place in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- right now, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
