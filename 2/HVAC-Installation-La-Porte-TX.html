<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
