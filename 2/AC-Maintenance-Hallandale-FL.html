<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual areas.<p>
