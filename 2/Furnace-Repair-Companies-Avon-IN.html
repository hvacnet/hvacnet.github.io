<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
