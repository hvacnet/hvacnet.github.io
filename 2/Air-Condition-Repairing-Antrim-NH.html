<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outdoors air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
