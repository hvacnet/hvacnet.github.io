<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps should likewise be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.)
