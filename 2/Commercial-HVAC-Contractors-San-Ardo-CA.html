<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
