<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally higher than many heatpump alternatives, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the model you acquire. One of the primary advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating choices. This implies it can warm up your house to the desired temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
