<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
