The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
