<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the exact same period. Essentially, SEER provides more data based upon how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The higher the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
