<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
