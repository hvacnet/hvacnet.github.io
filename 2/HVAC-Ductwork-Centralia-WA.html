<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known reality that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is simply as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will frequently develop in ductwork, restricting airflow.

The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the same duration. Basically, SEER supplies more information based on how the EER carries out in various temps. The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
