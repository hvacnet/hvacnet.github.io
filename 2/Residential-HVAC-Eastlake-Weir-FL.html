<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
