<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one response specified the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided.

For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, leading to cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
