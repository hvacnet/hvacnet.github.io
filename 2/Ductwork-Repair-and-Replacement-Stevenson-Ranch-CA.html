<h3>Commercial HVAC Contractors in Stevenson Ranch CA</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
