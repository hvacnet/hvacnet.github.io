<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
