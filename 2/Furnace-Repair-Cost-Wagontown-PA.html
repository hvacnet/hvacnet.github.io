<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
