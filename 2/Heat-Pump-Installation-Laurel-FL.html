<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical functions of eco-friendly houses as part of the growing green building movement. Green projects accounted for 20 percent of all newly constructed houses in the U.S. last year.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire real estate market.<p>
<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Laurel FL</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
