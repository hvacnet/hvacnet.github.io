<p>Just like houses, the most crucial aspect affecting indoor air quality is the existence of toxin sources. Commonly discovered office pollutants and their sources. include ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant structure materials; formaldehyde from pressed wood products; other organics from building products, carpet, and other workplace home furnishings, cleaning activities and materials, bathroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copier, and photography and print shops; biological pollutants from dirty ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air.
