These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While room a/c provides maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is typically more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
