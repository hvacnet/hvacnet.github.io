<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, most Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next action is to defrost your a/c equipment. The most convenient method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
