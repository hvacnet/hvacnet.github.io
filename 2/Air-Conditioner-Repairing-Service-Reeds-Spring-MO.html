Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
