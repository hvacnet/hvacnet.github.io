<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, flooring, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. Often there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in covert or seldom accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
