<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up examination results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>
