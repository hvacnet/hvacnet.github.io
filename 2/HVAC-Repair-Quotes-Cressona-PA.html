<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema.

<p>Usually the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items.

When asbestos-containing products are harmed or interrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if appropriate controls are not in location. This can lead to the capacity for significant illness.<p>
