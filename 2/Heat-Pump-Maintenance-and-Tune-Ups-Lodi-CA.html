<p>Expert heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC experts suggest following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>I have utilized around the clock for 5 plus years now. I have signed an annual maintenance agreement which covers two services every year. Ilan has actually been wonderful through all these years. Constantly keeps my system serviced and tuned. Haven't had any issues. Whenever he sees any concerns, he notifies me about it and proactively repairs the parts. Very pleased with their service. Would advise them anytime.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it might grovel two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a couple of years back.<p>
