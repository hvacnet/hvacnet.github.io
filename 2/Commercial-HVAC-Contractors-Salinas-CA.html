<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

But more intricate issues-- recognized by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack.
