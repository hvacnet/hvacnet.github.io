<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
