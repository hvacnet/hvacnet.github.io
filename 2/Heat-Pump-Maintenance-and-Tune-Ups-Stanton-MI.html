<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while describing whatever to me.
