One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to resist existing, which then creates heat.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outdoors air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
