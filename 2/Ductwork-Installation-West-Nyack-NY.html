<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant arising from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burned off.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
