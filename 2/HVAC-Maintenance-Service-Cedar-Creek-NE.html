<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your home may not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or smelly air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To detect odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
