<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment.

<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is typically higher than numerous heat pump alternatives, they can still be extremely effective, depending on the model you acquire.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
