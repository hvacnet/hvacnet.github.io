<p>The primary health result related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
