<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide car debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
