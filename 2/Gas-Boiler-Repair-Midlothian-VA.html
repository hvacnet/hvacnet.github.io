<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, considering that it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one action specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repetitive use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, causing fractures and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
