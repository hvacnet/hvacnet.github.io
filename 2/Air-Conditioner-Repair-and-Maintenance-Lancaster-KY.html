<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces in Lancaster KY</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC units even in winter. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
