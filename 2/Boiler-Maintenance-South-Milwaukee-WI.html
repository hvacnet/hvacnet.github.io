<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
