<p>I was very happy in the start since things ran efficiently without any sound. Additionally, I saw obvious changes in my electrical power costs. After two years, things started to change. There have been awkward sounds. I got it inspected and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. Overall, it has actually been an excellent experience. Dependable on the whole.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
