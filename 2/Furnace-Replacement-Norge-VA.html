<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk to your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
