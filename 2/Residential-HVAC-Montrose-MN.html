<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Companies in Montrose</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

The large bulk of these units are multi-family or mixed-use, where cooling is more of an industry standard, states Scott Vollmoeller of engineering company Glumac.<p>
<p>There are some more serious dangers for HVAC employees that could be potentially deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be toxic.

Although there are dangers associated with the task, it is normally performed safely as long as proper care is taken.<p>
<p>You might update to the highest efficiency equipment readily available and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The typical home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>
