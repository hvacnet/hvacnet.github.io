<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Fletcher NC</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

<p>Remember that the SEER ranking is determined utilizing the same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The average summertime temperature to come to the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to get to the right SEER score for your location, subtract 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema.

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, many of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
