<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Arroyo Seco NM</h3>

<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better solution. If the existing system has actually not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
