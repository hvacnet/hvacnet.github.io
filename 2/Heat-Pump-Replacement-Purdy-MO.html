<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the trouble location in looking over the expense. He resolved the issue in one day, had actually adjusted the expense to what I thought about fair before he recalled, understood what might have triggered the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not occur again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>My oldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it actually didnÃ¢ $ t disperse air like it did before. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itÃ¢ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
