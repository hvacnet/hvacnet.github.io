<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very happy they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>

For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the tools or abilities essential to examine refrigerant levels.

<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
