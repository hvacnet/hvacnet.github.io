Typically, annual coil cleaning, regular check, and filter modifications are the only maintenance needed to keep whatever performing correctly.<p>

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a few years earlier.<p>
