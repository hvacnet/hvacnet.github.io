<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
