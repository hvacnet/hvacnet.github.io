<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>

<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might notice moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.

The structure type included both residential and commercial. The majority of samples examined were checked positive for fungi and germs.<p>
