<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy.

Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
