<h2>How To Hire HVAC Service in Spring Lake</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
