The ideal humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Before you go out and purchase an air conditioning unit, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be?

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
