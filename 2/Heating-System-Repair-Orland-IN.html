One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to resist current, which then creates heat.<p>
