Kids, babies, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults considering that lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the damaging effects of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
