<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
