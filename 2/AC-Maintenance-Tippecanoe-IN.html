The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. If your home is not heating up, just be worried. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice.

<p>Heaters as they age run the risk of establishing fractures in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide, if present, could leak into your house unnoticed.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
