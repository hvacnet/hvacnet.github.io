<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial structures, apartment buildings and huge houses.

A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
