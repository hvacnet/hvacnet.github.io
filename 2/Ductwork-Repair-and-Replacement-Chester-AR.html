<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>Heaters are like automobiles. As they age, you can change one part just require another part changed or repaired next year.
