<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
