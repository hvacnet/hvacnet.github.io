<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the condenser, compressor, and evaporator are all situated in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roofing system or on a concrete slab beside your home's foundation. This type of air conditioning system likewise is used in little commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts come from inside through the home's outside wall or roofing to connect with the packaged air conditioning unit, which is typically located outdoors. Packaged air conditioners frequently include electric heating coils or a gas furnace.

<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Rising Sun IN</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
