<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
