My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>My eldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
