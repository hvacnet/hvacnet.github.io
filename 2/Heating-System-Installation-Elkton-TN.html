Choose in between our bronze, platinum, gold, and silver plans, and we'll provide you with the greatest level of security and maintenance.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
