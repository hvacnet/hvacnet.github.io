Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are safe and secure and tight.<p>
<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating unit in Seattle homes.

If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
