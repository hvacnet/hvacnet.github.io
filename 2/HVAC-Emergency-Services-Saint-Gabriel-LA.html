This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
