<p>It is likewise advised for citizens of Redmond to have access to heater inside their homes. Throughout the winter seasons, heating systems provide sufficient heating power to homes in the community. The average daytime temperature level highs throughout December, January, and February variety from the mid-40s to low-50s. Temperatures will drop below freezing during the night, and heavy rainfall prevails throughout the winter months. When effectively installed and well maintained, heating systems supply sufficient heating power to Redmond, Washington homes.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
