<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
