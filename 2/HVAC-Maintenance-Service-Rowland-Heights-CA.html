<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
