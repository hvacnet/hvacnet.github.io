<p>The most common type of house heater in the U.S. burns natural gas or lp to produce heat. With a typical cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly option, however newer systems can be extremely energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems normally achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely effective gas heating systems can achieve AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
