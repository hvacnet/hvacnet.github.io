<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time.
