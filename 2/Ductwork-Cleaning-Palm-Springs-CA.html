<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
