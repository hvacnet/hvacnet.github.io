<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the result of repeated usage of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.  a very helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
