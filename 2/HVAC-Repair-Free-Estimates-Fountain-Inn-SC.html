<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to order it. My better half stated that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent individuals I have actually met in a long period of time.
