<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities trigger mold development and wetness inside is associated with a greater occurrence of resident respiratory issues.<p>

The process of solving indoor air quality issues that lead to health and comfort grievances can be a slow one, including several trial options prior to effective remedial actions are recognized.<p>
