<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
