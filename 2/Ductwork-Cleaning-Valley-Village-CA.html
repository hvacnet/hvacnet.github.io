<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Valley Village CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
