<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
