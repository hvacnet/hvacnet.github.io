<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges employed flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
<h3>Commercial Boiler Heating Repair in Ravensdale WA</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Ravensdale WA</h3>
