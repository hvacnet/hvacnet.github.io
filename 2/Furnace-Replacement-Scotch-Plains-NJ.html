<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
