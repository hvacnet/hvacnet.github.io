<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay items. Since they only partially get rid of the radon decay products and do not lessen the quantity of radon entering the house, the effectiveness of these devices is unpredictable. EPA prepares to do extra research study on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a reliable means of reducing the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides more details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health effects discussed. However, it is not necessarily true that the effects noted take place at the pollutant concentration levels typically found in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health impacts is too limited to figure out the levels at which the listed effects could take place.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
