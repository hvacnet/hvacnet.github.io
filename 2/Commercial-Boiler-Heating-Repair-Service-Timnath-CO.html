<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw.
