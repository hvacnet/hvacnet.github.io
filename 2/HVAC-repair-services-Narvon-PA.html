<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, specifically if you make it part of a build or renovation project.

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
