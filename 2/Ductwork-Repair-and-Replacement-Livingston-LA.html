<h3>How to Limit the Prices of Air Conditioner Repair in Livingston LA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
