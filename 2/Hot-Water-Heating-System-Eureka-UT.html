<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other types of heatpump, have actually effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE OFFICER. It's a scientific method of identifying how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. Most geothermal heat pump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0. This indicates for every single unit of energy utilized to power the system, 3 to 5 systems are provided as heat.<p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might grovel two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
