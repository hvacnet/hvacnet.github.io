<p>PE companies tend to run with the objective of selling or spinning off a firm at some point. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large service in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management.

<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often hard to measure, as one response stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of recurring usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, leading to holes and fractures. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  a very useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
