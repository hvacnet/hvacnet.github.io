<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
