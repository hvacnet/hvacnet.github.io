<p>These guys have actually been great. At a real estate agent, I in some cases need contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a house might cost. Just recently I needed to call on these guys twice. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my client probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Talk with you soon.<p>
