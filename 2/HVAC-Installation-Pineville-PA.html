<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>For instance, problems develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in sufficient amounts of outdoor air.
