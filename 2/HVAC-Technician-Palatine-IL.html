<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
