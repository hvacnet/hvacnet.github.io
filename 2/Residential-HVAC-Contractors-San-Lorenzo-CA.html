<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the prospective to adversely affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
