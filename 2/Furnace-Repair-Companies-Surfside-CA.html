<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
