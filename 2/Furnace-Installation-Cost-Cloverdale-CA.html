<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for bids. While both were informative and helpful, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a better offer, for remarkable service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating unit and situated methods we could have more even heat.

We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump due to the fact that of current warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
