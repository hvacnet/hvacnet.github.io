<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
