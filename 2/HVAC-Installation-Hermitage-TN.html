<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated delay features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
