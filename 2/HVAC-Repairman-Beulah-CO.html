<h3>Truth About Beulah CO Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house building is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, roofs, and floors. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Room air conditioners feature a thermostat sensor, situated behind the control panel, which measures the temperature of air entering into the evaporative coil. If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the ac system might cycle continuously or act unpredictably. The sensing unit must be near the coil but not touching it; adjust its position by thoroughly bending the wire that holds it in place.<p>
