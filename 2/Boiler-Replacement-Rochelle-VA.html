<h3>Which Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Rochelle VA?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
