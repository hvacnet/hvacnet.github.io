<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Englewood CO</h3>

The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
