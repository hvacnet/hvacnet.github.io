<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
