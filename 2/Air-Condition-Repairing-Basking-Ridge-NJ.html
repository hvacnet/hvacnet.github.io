<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractor in Basking Ridge</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
