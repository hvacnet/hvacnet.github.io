<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

A split-system is the most cost-effective central air conditioner to install if your home currently has a furnace but no air conditioner.<p>
