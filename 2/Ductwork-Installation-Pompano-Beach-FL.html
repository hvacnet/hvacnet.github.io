<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has actually become an important concern to property owners and health professionals. Indoor air pollution studies have actually recognized several impurities that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion products, volatile organic compounds (consisting of formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Appropriate ventilation and removal of the sources of these impurities are essential in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and huge houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and wear.
