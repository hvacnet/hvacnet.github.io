<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Longboat Key FL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
