<p>These people have actually been fantastic. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what work on a home might cost. Recently I needed to contact these guys two times. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my client probably wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Stability isn't simply their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>
