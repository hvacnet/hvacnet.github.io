<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically crucial to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping track of data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this data may identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping track of data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
