<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
