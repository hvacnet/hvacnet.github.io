<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>

In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
