<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space.

Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
