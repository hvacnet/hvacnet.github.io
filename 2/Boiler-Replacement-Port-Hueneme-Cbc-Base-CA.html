<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Port Hueneme Cbc Base CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
