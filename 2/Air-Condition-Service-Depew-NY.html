Call an experienced technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips.
