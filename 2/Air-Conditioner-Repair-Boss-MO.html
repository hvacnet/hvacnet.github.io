By comparison, examining and replacing a furnace filter can normally be done in just a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
