<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
