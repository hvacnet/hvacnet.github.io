<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Fremont MO Home</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house building and construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, roofings, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
