<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
