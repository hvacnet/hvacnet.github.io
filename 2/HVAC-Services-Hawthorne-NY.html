Gas furnace not blowing hot air? Simply as with switches, someone may have shut off a gas valve and after that forgotten to turn it back on.

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're probably hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it requires from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the chances are good that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's finest to change the capacitor.<p>

In this case, the control system is really critical to preserving an appropriate temperature.<p>
