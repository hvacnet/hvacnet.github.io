<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy.

Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the system running.
