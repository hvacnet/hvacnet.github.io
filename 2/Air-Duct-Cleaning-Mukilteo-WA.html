<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area, stale air may also be a problem.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
