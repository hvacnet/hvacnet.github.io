<h3>Furnace Service in Selman City TX</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months prior to the current one expired.
