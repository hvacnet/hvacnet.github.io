<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Saint Amant LA</h3>
<p>For whole home installations, it's hard, if almost impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing home, particularly a hydronic system. Localized radiant flooring heat systems to be utilized in one or numerous spaces like bathrooms, kitchens or laundry rooms are easily refurbished with electric radiant floor heat. This is a lot more cost-effective on a smaller sized scale. Bigger renovations like additions to a house may be suitable for a larger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
