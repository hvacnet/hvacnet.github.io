Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.
