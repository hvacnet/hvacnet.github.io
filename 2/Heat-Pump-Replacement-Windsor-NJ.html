<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power must not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, since the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for bids. While both were practical and useful, Ballard Gas provided us a better offer, for remarkable service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating unit and located methods we might have more even heat.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
