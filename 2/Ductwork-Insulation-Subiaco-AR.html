Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>

Local building regulations likely define the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that need to be continuously supplied in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation paired with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
