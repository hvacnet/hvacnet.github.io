Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
