<h3>Residential Heat Pumps in Somerset NJ</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys.

In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan.
