<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system.

Simply put, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not easy, because it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
