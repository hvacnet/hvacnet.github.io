<p>The possibility of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends on numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might see musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
