What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
