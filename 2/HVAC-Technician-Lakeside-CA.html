<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
