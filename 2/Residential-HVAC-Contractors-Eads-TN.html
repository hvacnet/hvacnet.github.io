<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
