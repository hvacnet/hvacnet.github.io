<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner.
