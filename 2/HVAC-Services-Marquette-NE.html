<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
