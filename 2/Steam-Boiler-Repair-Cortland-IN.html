<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Health Problem (BRI) refers to less frequent (however typically more serious) cases of people becoming ill after being in a particular building at a certain time. In these cases, there is usually a similar set of clinical signs experienced by the people and a clear cause can often be discovered upon examination. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI caused by germs which can pollute a building's a/c system.<p>
<p>The very first ac system and fridges employed combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Cortland IN</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Some health results may show up soon after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a pollutant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are generally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just removing the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins, symptoms of some illness such as asthma might appear, be aggravated or aggravated.<p>
