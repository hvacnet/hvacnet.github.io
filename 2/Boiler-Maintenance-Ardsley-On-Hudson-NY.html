However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
