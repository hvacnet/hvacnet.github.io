<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My partner stated that she had seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have fulfilled in a long period of time.
