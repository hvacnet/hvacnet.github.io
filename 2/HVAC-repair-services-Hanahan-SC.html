<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most cost effective if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
