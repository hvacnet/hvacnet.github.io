<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
