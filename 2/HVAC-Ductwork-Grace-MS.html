<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Heating systems that kick on often may be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>

Because an unit is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
