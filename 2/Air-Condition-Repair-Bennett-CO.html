<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
