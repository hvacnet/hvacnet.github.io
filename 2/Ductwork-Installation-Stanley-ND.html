<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors.

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
