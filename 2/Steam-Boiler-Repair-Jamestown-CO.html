<p>The exhaust outlets permit all harmful gases to leave your residential or commercial property so there's no risky buildup of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can cause a dangerous accumulation and compromise your security. The technician will evaluate all of these aspects of your system and inspect the chimney flue and vent stack as well.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have actually been appropriately dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
