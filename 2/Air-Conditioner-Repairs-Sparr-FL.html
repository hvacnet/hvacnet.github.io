<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
