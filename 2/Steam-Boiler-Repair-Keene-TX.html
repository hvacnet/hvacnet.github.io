Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers relatively.
