<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still heats up to the best temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot. If your house is not heating up, only be worried. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to employ a professional to examine and repair the unit.<p>

<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is frosty. Also, if the a/c unit smells bad, there could be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the air conditioning system's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>To be sincere, few of the facilities managers who use our indoor air quality monitoring service concerned us for that reason. Generally they were at first interested in remotely keeping track of some other element of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't until later, as they continued dealing with us, that they found out about and carried out indoor air quality keeping track of to provide a much healthier, much safer structure environment-- and to head off the negative consequences related to indoor air toxins.<p>
