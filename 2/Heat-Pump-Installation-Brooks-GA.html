<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
