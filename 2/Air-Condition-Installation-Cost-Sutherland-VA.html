<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
