Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
