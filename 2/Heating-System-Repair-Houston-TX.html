<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
