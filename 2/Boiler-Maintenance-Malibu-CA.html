Obligations for indoor air quality problems are usually divided amongst several agencies. Calling or writing the agencies responsible for health or air quality assurance is the best method to start getting information from your state or city government. To acquire state company contacts, call or write EPA's IAQ Details Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. area.<p>
<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for lowering the air quality in your home, however there are lots of other pollutants that can not only filthy up the air, however lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>There are a couple of main points that house owners will wish to take into account when choosing which of the best AC systems they ought to install in their houses.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
