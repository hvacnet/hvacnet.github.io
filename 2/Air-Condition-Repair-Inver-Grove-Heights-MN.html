<h3>Electric Heating in Inver Grove Heights MN</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
