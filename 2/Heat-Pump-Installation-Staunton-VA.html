<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
