<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the floor or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat circulation over the entire surface of a flooring warms the lower half of the space, covering occupants in heat at a lower total temperature level-- sometimes as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heater." Simply put, in-floor heater provide a various mode and level of convenience.
