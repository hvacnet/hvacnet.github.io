<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of changing or exchanging air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive wetness, introduces outside air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Because pesticides can be found far from the site of their initial application, it is sensible to minimize making use of chemical pesticides outdoors in addition to inside your home. Depending upon the website and pest to be controlled, several of the following actions can be efficient: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and regular cleaning of indoor plants and animals. Termite damage can be lowered or avoided by making certain that wooden building materials do not come into direct contact with the soil and by keeping fire wood away from the house.
