<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and solidify-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
