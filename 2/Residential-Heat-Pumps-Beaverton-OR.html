<p>When our furnace was dying, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were useful and helpful, Ballard Gas provided us a much better offer, for exceptional service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating unit and located methods we could have more even heat. He included these minor but substantial changes in his quote. We decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of current warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Beaverton OR</h3>
<p>Sean was really practical. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Ensure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
