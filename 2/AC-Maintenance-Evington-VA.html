So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service strategy which generally consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly.
