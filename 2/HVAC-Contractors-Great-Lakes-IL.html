HVAC professionals advise following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
