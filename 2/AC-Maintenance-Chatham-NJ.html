<p>While radon in water is not an issue in houses served by a lot of public water supplies, it has been found in well water. If you've checked the air in your house and found a radon issue, and you have a well, contact a lab licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon issues in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the problem location in looking over the expense. He solved the issue in one day, had actually changed the bill to what I thought about reasonable before he called back, understood what may have triggered the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not take place again. I have considered All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have actually used them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually greater than lots of heat pump options, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the model you buy. One of the primary advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating alternatives. This implies it can heat up your home to the preferred temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
