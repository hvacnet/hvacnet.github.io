<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
