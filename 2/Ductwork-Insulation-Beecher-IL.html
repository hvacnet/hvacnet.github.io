<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature.

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve.
