<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
