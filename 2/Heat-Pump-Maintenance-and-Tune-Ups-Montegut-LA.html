<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
