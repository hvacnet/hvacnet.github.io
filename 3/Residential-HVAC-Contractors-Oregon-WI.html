<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally brought on by the absence of adequate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of impurities from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the work environment indoor air investigations it has actually carried out. Investigations performed in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the same to be real. These investigations revealed that proper ventilation is important in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in gathering details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>

He also responded to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a short-lived fix to an issue that couldn't be dealt with on the very first visit due to not available parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and capability to provide constant, quality service.<p>
