<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. When the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and treat-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
