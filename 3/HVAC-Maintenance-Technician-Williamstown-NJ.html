<p>Buildings are designed or intended to react actively to a few of these changes around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same.

Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
