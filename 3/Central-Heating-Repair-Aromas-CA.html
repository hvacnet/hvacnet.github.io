<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor environmental quality") describes how inside air can affect a person's capability, comfort, and health to work.

Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards but it does offer guidelines about the most common IAQ office grievances.<p>
