In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat.

The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
