<h3>AC And Heating Repair in Clarksville AR</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
