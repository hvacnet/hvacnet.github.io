These convection heaters are still widely used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
