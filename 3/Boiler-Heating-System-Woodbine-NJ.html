<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
