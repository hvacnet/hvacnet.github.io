Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated up in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a few feet below ground.

<p>It is not suggested that "routine" occupational exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to determine if the general indoor air quality meets a particular standard. Occupational direct exposure limits noted in health and safety guidelines and the Threshold Limit Worths ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to prevent disease or certain impacts (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial scenarios. These limitations may not be proper in workplace settings or for the home.<p>

This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home.
