Gas heaters cost about the same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works however the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
