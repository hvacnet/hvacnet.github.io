<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
