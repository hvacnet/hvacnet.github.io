Pressed wood items produced indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that perfect temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually consists of a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
