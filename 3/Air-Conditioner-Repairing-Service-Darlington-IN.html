<p>Immediate results might appear after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are treatable and normally short-term. Often the treatment is merely getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Signs of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise show up not long after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might see unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak with your doctor about them.
