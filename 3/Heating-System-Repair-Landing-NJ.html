<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Landing NJ</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are incredibly efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for each unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
