<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that best temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task.
