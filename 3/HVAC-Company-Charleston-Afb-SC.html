<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
