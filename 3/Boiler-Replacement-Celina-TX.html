Natural ventilation schemes can use extremely little energy, however care needs to be required to guarantee convenience. In damp or warm environments, maintaining thermal convenience solely by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when appropriate.<p>
