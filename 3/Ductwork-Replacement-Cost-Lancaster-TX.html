<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Lancaster TX</h3>
<p>Forced air systems are the most typical heating system types on the market, however they're not constantly the very best option for each home. If you're trying to find a new heater for your house, you must have a look at a few of the other options offered prior to picking a system that might not fit your needs best. Radiant heating, for instance, may be a far better fit for your requirements.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Many AC systems include a number of special functions that can further enhance performance and efficiency. For instance, property owners may want to try to find one that includes an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter requires to be changed. Another popular function to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on during the night to minimize energy costs a lot more. Naturally, more functions indicate higher central air conditioning costs.<p>
