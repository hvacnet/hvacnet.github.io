<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
