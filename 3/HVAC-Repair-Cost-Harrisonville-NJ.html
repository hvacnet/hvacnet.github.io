<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was type of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved issues. I would suggest this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with the house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the assessment on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace declaring health hazard reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new property owner I have discovered how to recognize the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
