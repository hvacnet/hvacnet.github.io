<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractor in Hurst</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
