Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
