For instance, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar energy relies on regular sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a available and reliable  source of energy.<p>
