<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
