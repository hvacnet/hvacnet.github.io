<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>When mounting a wall sensor, consider the height at which they need to be positioned. The majority of typically they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people primarily stay seated in that particular location.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside buildings are normally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
