<h3>How to Select An Expert HVAC Tech in Tifton GA</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
