<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Idaville IN</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in Idaville IN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater.
