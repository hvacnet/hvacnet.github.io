The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.
