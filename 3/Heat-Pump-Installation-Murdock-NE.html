Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
