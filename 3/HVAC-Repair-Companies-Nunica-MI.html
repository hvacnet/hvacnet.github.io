<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
