PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them.

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years ago and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
