<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Luis, Melissa and Herbert were all a great help and very expert! Quick reaction time and kept in contact the whole time. Really easy financing procedure, outstanding interaction and terrific service! I don't typically do evaluations but this lot earns every star they have.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively.

Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
