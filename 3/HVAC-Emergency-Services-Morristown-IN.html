The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>

Excess wetness can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, uneven temperature regulation, bacteria, and compromised air quality. An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to make sure all excess wetness flows away from the system.<p>
