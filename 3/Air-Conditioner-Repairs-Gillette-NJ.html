He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent individuals I have actually fulfilled in a long period of time.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
