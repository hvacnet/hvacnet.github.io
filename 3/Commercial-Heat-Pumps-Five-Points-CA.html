<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, electrical power or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can attain approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
