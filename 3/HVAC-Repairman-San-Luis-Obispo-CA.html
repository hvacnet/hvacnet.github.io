Natural ventilation plans can utilize very little energy, but care needs to be required to ensure comfort. In warm or humid climates, maintaining thermal convenience exclusively by means of natural ventilation might not be possible. A/c systems are utilized, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers likewise utilize outside air to condition areas, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when proper.<p>
