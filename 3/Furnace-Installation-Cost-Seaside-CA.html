<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Seaside CA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate.

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
