<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators.

Convected heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
