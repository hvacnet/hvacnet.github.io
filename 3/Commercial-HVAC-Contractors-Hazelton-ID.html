<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
