The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future.

<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical technique of minimizing direct exposure to indoor air contaminants, likewise will decrease but not remove exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Mechanical or natural ventilation strategies do not eliminate them from the air in your home as rapidly as they construct up due to the fact that smoking produces such large amounts of pollutants. In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it requires to substantially minimize exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses significantly. Consequently, the most effective way to reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to remove cigarette smoking there.<p>
