<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the prospective to negatively impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor ought to examine and, if required, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more reliable solution to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>The EPA recommends that you have your air ducts examined by a professional heating and cooling contractor.

<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of toxin exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.
