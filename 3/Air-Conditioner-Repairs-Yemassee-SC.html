Technicians are typically required to work in cramped areas, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofs of houses. They can be exposed to unfavorable weather for long periods of time.

<p>Another impurity of indoor air is outside air. At the height of the pollen season or when the air quality index is unhealthy, individuals with asthma may find being inside uses the best relief, if the indoor air environment is great. Although a/c does not filter the air, it assists people with asthma due to the fact that windows and doors are kept shut, which helps keep pollens and other outdoor irritants and allergens out of the home. An unexpected shift in temperature from warm to cold can also an asthma attack.<p>
<p>If you have a big home, a house with high ceilings, a house with numerous windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floorings instead of the air might not be enough to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed.
