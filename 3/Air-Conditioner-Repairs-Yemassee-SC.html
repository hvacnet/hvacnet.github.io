An unexpected shift in temperature from warm to cold can also an asthma attack.<p>
<p>If you have a big home, a house with high ceilings, a house with numerous windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floorings instead of the air might not be enough to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed.
