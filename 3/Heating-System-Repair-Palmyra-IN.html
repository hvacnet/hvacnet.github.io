<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
