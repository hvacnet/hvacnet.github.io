<p>. Prior to choosing the installation place of air conditioning system, several main elements require to be thought about. To start with, the instructions of air flow from the indoor systems ought to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there must not be any challenges en route of the airflow that may avoid it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible.
