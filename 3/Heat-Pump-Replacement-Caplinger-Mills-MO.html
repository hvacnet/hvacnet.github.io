<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power should not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, because the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not simple, given that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts.

In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
