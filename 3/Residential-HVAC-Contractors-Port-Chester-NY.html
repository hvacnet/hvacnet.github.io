<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Port Chester NY?</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the needed electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<h3>Gas Boiler Repair in Port Chester NY</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
