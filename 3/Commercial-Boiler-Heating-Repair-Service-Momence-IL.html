<p>Dometic's commercial grade roof a/c are performance-tested to get rid of extreme or unusual road and weather conditions.

The galvanized steel top plate offers enduring strength while long copper lines minimize vibration and, therefore, noise too. While being among the most difficult air conditioning system around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, capable and light-weight of performing in any environment! It won't let you down.<p>
<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
