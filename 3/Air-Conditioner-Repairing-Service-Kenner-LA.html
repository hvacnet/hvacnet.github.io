<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Kenner</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can suggest significant savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with debris that can limit airflow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down entirely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
