<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
