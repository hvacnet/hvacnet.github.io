<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do recognize a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heater and pick to install it in your house, you could be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs. (And these expenses can be significant. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, house owners can expect to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.)
