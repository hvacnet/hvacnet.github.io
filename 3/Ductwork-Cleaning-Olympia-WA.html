<h3>Air Condition Repair in Olympia WA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most economical if your house or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
