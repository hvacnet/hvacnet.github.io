Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated home once again. What's most remarkable was that this all taken place during Thanksgiving week!

<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Jenner CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
