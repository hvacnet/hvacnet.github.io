<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure truth that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will often build up in ductwork, limiting air flow. Because ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem extremely complicated initially, requiring specialized tools, devices, and know-how. When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
