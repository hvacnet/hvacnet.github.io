The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
