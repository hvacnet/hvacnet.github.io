<h3>Ductless AC System in Highland Park NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and very well done. The installers were respectful and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize easily people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss out on detail that produces a job extremely well done. I really highly suggest the two gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and appreciation for a job well done.<p>
<p>Its special feature is the existence of one primary external unit that linked to numerous indoor units. Such systems might be the ideal service for keeping the microclimate in a number of workplaces, shops, big home. Simply few of outdoor units do not get worse the aesthetic appearance of the building. The main external unit can be linked to several different indoor types: flooring, ceiling, cassette, etc<p>
