We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants.

<p>Radiant heating uses a variety of distinct benefits over forced air heater. For example, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

Transmitting heat through solid objects will likewise cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home warmed by a glowing system will heat up faster, and remain warm with less energy invested. These are simply a few of the many advantages that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>
