<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
