<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2.

<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home.

<p>Over the past few years, there has actually been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have actually been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is currently no evidence, nevertheless, that an affordable number of houseplants eliminate significant quantities of contaminants in homes and workplaces. Since extremely wet soil might promote the development of microorganisms which can impact allergic people, indoor houseplants should not be over-watered.<p>
