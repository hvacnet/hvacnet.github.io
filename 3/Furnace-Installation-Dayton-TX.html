Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that protect your cooling system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good possibility; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen.
