<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
