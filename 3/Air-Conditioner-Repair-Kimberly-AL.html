<p>The primary factor property owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the quantity of services provided. If the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's warranty, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any major repairs must be covered under the maker's service warranty. However, some manufacturers need regular maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, given that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
