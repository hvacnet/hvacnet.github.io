<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies.

<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Angleton TX</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
