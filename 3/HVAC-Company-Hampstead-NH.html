<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage.

And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
