The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>
