Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
