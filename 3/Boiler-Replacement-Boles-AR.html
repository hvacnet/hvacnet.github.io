The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not go beyond the capability of the outside unit.

Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level.

Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
