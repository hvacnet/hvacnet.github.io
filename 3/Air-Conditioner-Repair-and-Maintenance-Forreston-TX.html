<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated delay features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might see moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
