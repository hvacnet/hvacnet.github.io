<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
