<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
