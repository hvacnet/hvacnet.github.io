Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
