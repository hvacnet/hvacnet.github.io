<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
