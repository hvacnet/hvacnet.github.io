<h3>Boiler Installation in Reseda CA</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer must check measurements of air, temperature and humidity flow. In addition, assessment and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make sure it is working according to specifications for constructing usage and tenancy) should be performed. A building walk-through to look for odors and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings might be handy. Leaks need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofs and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with germs or fungis and require to be eliminated, likewise. In some situations, particular testing for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of building occupancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me problem shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on price. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
