Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure materials, smoking, family items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems.

<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
