<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
