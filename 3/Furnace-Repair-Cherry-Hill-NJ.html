<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
