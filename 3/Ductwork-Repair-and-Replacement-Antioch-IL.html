This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
