<p>If you remain in the first couple of years of service, you might decide to keep your service and product line simple for now. But if you are an established business in the process of revising your heating & cooling business plan, consider whether you are ready to include some complementary sales or services, such as plumbing, insulation, duct sealing, indoor air quality examination or system performance reviews.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your employer ought to examine measurements of temperature level, humidity and air flow. In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to ensure it is working according to specs for constructing use and occupancy) must be performed. A building walk-through to look for smells and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or bug droppings might be handy. Leakages require to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with fungis or germs and need to be removed, also. In some circumstances, particular screening for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of building tenancy.

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your car. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
