<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group masters integrating a multidisciplinary method to indoor air quality (IAQ) obstacles.

No matter what HVAC system you utilize to heat your house, trust us for all your heating requires. Our service technicians have the experience to get the job done, no matter the size of your system. Because the Treasure Valley location can see some incredibly cold temperature levels, maintenance and system upkeep is more crucial than ever. The lower the temperature levels, the more work your heating system needs to withstand.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits per year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and usually some other benefits. Some companies use priority visits to their maintenance plan members.<p>

<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably average, you can anticipate a minimum of 30 days during which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Just a couple of years ago, Seattle saw a record temperature of 103 degrees, and there have actually been lots of long, dry, hot streaks since then.

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's probably your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to defrost your air conditioning devices.
