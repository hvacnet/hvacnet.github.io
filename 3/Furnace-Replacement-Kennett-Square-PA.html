In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
