Some sources, such as building products, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release pollutants basically constantly.

<p>The first a/c and fridges used harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to deadly accidents when they dripped.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
