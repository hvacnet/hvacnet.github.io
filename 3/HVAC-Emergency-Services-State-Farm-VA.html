<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating system is more reputable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy relies on regular sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a trusted and offered source of energy.<p>
