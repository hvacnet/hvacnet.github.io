<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be efficiently identified or remedied without a comprehensive building investigation. These examinations might begin with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which structure private investigators assess the history of resident symptoms and structure operation procedures. In some cases, these questions may quickly discover the issue and on-site sees are unneeded.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions.
