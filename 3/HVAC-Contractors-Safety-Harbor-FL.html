<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might see musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your medical professional about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
