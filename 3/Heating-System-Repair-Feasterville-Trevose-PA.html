<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any airflow limitation will lower the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those measurements on hand when shopping for an air conditioning unit to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window. Also, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to set up the air conditioner: Don't position it in an egress window that serves as the only methods of escape must a fire emerge.<p>
