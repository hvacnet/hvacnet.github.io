<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is likewise an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
