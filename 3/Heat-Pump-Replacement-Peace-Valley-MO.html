<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
