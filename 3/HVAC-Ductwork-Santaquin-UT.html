<p>I am really satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
