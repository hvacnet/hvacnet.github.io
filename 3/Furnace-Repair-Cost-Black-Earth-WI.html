Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
