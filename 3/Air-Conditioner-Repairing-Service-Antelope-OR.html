<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
