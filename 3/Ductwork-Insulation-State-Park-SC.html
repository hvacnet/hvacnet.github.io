Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Pressed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is usually recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
