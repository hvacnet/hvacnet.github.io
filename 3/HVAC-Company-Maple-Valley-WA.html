<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
