<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
