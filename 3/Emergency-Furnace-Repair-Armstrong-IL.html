<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee.
