<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the house. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
