<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing material bought with your home. This company presented a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the assessment on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health risk factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new homeowner I have learned how to recognize the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
