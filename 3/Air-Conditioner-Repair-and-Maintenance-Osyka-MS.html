A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires dealt with by professionals, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>

Most modern warm water boiler heater have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
