Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
