<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a service was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
