<h3>Air Conditioning Contractors in Farmington AR</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
