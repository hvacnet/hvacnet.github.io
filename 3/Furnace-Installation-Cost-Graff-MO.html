<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when buying an ac system to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window. Likewise, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to install the a/c unit: Do not place it in an egress window that serves as the only ways of escape need to a fire appear.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for house owners to consider. Often times, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally only offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
