<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Many people are becoming more conscious and concerned about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing pollutants and allergens can cover the a/c ductwork with time.

Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans up the air ducts physically by removing the particles from the air filter.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the kind of electrical energy. The two operations use various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to attain its objectives.<p>
