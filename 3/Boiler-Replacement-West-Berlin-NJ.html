<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have actually been revealed to trigger the health results discussed. However, it is not always true that the effects noted take place at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health effects is too minimal to determine the levels at which the listed effects could occur.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
