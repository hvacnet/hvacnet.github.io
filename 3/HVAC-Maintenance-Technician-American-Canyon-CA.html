Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
