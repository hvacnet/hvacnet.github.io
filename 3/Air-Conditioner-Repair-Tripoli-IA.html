<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
