<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run because it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
