<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
