<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
