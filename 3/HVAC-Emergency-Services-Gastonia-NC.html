<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC.
