<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. The majority of modern-day hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
