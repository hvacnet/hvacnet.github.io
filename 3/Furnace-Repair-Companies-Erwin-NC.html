<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or ac system do not just break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the result of repetitive usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, leading to cracks and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.  a very useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
