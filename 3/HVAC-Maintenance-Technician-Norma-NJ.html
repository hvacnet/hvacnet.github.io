<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk with your medical professional about them.
