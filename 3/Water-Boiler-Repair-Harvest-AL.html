<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems in homes.

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
