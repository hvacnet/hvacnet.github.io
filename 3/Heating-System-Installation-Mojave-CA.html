<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, nausea, and trouble in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
