Reputable on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the start. However then recognized Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
