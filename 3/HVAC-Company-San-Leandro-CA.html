<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
