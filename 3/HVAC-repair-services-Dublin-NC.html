<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part.

<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
