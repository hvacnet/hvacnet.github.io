<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
