<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Flanders NJ</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
