<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
