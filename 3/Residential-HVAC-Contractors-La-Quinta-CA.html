The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- immediately, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
