<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future.

Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
