<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My other half stated that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have met in a long time. We need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us if we want to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
