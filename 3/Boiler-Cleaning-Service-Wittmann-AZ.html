<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, in addition to all other kinds of heatpump, have effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance, or COP.

Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
