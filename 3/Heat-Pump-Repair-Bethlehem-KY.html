<h3>How to Limit the Costs of Air Conditioner Repair in Bethlehem KY</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
