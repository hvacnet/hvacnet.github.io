<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.
