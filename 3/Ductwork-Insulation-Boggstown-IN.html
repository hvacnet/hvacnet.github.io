<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Quite a bit of research study enters into changing or repairing a gas furnace such as picking the ideal devices and selecting the ideal contractor for the task. Being thorough and doing your homework will increase the opportunities of a smooth furnace installation or repair. Use our helpful HVAC contractor list during your HVAC installation to make things simpler on you and your furnace repair individual.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
