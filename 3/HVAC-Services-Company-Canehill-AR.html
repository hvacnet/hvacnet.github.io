<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
