<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product.
