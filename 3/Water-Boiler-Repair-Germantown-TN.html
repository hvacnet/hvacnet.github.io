<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>When installing the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one involved excavation, running hundreds of yards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is rather pricey. Setting up a new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably average, you can anticipate a minimum of one month during which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 last year! Simply a few years earlier, Seattle saw a record temperature of 103 degrees, and there have been plenty of long, dry, hot streaks ever since. A central air conditioning system in your house suggests you have the power to adjust the temperature level to a constant temperature when the heat gets intolerable.<p>
