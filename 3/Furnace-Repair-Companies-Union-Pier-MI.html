<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã Many heaters have several control boards. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnÃ¢ $ t correctly identified, altering a board wonÃ¢ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once set up. ItÃ¢ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
