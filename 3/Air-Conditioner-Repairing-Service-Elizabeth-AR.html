<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have multiple control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively detected, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
