<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>For example, pollutants may gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption lies near a source of wetness or other outside pollutant, it might function as a pathway to carry the pollutants inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working along with it needs to-- if debris is blocking the outside air consumption, for instance, or the filters are infected or badly preserved.<p>
