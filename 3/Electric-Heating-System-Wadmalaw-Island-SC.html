<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heaters have several control panel. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively detected, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
