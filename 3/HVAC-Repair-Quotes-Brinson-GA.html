<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room.
