<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
