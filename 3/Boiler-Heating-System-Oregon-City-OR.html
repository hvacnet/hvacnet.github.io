<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
