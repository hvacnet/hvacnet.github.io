<p>A customized a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air course.

Nevertheless, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
