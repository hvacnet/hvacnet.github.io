If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract..
