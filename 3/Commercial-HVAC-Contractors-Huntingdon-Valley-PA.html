<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
