<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
