<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My other half stated that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good individuals I have actually fulfilled in a very long time. We need to support the genuine people who are there for us if we want to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often essential to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs.
