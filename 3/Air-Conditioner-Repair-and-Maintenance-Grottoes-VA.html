<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outside) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely specify the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outside air that must be continuously provided in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA).

<p>The primary factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services used.

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
