In practice, nevertheless, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the very same time, since the total capability of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level.
