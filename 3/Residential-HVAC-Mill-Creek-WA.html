<p>Specific immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently difficult to figure out if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is essential to pay attention to the time and place the symptoms occur. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort ought to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions prevalent in the house.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a couple of years back.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
