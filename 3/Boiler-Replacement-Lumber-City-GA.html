<p>Because pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application, it is prudent to lower using chemical pesticides outdoors as well as inside your home. Depending on the site and pest to be controlled, several of the following steps can be reliable: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and pets. Termite damage can be reduced or prevented by making certain that wood building materials do not enter direct contact with the soil and by storing fire wood away from the home.
