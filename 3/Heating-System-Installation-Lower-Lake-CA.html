<p>There are many things to consider when trying to determine how often I must change my cooling filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how typically your a/c filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better ideal choice on how typically your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one air conditioning filter need replacing regularly.<p>
