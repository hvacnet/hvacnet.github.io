<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
