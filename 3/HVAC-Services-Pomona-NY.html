<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
