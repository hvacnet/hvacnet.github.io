<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, think about possible results of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's directions, particularly guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater correctly changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating system remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
