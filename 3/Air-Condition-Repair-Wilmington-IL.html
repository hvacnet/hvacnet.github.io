<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter season can exacerbate problems. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to throw open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it's important to be familiar with a few of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that might be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
