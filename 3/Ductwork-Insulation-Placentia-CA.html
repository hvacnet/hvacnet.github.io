<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used various methodologies. The CMHC study contacted numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they belonged to a research study, and the scientists did not control for time invested or techniques used. The EPA study recommended and controlled methods used on a smaller sized number of homes.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
