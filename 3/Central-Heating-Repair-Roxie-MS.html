<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were practical and informative, Ballard Natural Gas provided us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and located methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small but considerable adjustments in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of current warmer summer seasons and for environmental factors.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
