That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

A more energy efficient home will not just reduce the cost of a new system and energy costs, but it will significantly improve the comfort of your home. Prior to we design and set up any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements.
