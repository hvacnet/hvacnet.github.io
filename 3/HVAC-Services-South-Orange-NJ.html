<p>Lots of AC units come with a number of special functions that can even more improve performance and effectiveness. For instance, property owners may want to search for one that includes a built-in filter light that will alert you when the air filter needs to be altered.

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
