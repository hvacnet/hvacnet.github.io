<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>A health questionnaire ought to be developed and distributed to all concerned workers. Such a tool should determine the number of individuals impacted; define ages and task descriptions of involved workers; identify where they are located within the office; indicate when the signs occur (time of day, day of week, and time of year); provide a list of particular health signs or illnesses; determine all machines run in the office; suggest the type of outdoors air pollution; and identify prospective sources of job stress.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot next to the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, humans exhale carbon dioxide, which in little quantities is not toxic, but might become dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to collect. Micro-organisms or germs may likewise exist within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the entire workplace or structure by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
