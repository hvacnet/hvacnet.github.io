It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how typically your air conditioning filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better ideal choice on how often your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less frequently you'll have to clean them.
