<p>Air contaminants can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant resulting from gas that gets away into your house without being burnt.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
