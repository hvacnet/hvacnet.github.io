<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons.

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract tries to upsell you whenever they concern carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400?

She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
