<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores. The main risk of mold development, as it connects to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than the majority of allergenic residential or commercial properties is the ability of mold to activate episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a major respiratory disease.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
