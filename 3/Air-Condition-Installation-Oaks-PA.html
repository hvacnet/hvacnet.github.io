<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to provide enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
