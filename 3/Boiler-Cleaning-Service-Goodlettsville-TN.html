<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites should find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a harsh, harsh summer.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
