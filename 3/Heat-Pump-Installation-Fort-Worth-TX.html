Lots of common structure materials utilized prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the building materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling.
