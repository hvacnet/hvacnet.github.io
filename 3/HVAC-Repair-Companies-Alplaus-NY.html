<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll save money over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as standard air-source systems. The lack of moving parts indicates you're less likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
