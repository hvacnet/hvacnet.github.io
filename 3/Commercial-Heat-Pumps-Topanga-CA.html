<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Need to Know in Topanga CA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very happy that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the a/c unit before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
