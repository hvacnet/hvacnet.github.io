<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Want to Know in Garner NC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
