<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an abnormally high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had identified the problem area in examining the expense. He dealt with the issue in one day, had actually changed the costs to what I considered reasonable prior to he called back, knew what may have triggered the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not happen once again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have used them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>My oldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
