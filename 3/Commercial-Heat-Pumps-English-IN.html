<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
