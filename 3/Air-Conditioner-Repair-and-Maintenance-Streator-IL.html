<p>Professional heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental rule when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment and very large residences. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement expenses in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
