Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside might trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in most structures.
