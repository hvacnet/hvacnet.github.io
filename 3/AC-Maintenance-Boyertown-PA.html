<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Boyertown PA</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
