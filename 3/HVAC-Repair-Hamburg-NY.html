<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from usage.

Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
