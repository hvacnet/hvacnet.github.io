<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
