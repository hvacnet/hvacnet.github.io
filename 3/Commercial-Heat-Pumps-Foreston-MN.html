<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
