<p>My oldest son constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously.

The noise level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
