Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

<h3>Electric Heating System in Baxley GA</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
