<p>There are many actions a house owner can require to choose products that will avoid indoor air issues from occurring - a number of them are mentioned here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, think about using strong wood items. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make certain that an effective wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
