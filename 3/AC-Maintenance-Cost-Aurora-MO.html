High-efficiency designs cost more, however conserve more over the long haul. Costs for gas furnaces range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs as much as $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric heating systems begin at $395 and range up to $1,700 or more depending on the brand name and furnace size.<p>
