<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, an expert service individual must be called for almost any maintenance aside from regular cleaning. Central air conditioners need to be expertly checked and changed before the start of every cooling season. However, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup.
