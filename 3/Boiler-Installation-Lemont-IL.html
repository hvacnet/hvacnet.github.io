<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
