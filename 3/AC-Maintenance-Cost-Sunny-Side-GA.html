<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on.

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
