<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
