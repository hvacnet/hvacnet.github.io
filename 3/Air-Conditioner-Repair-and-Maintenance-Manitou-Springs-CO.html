<p>Many individuals ignore the level of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is typically envisioned as the black smoke emitted from factories. Little thought is given to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, paints, pesticides, and cleaners utilized in the house.

<p>Energy efficiency can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by numerous thermostats.
