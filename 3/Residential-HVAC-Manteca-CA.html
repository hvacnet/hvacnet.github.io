<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might get in close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
