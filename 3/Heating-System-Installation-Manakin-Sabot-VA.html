As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%.

<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is truthful, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
