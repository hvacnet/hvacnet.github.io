<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work.

He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

It takes really little time to warm up or cool off the house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by only using the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed agent from a company or merchant to do the installation. If you pick to try to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the a/c system. A voided warranty won't do you any great ought to the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the get-go and hire a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
