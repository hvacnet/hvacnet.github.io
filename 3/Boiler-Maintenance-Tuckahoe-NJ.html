<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have two significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty.

<p>Radiant heating involves installing coils or pipes in the flooring, offering heat from below and moving up. It presents an even, general heat temperature throughout the space.
