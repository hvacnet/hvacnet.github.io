<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
