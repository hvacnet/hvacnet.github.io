<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites should discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a terrible, terrible summer.<p>
