<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also.
