<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same way as a vehicle radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that ideal temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which normally consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are handled in a method that develops dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these items present a danger only. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or interrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become air-borne if appropriate controls are not in location. This can lead to the capacity for significant health problems.<p>
