<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't position the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it because it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will reduce the system's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil.

If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next step is to thaw your a/c equipment. The most convenient method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
