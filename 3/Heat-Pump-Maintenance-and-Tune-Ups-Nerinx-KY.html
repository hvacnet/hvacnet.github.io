<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor at Nerinx KY</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler normally take place. For the most part, the belt is incorrectly aligned or worn and requires replacement. Follow the guidelines above under A/c Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>
