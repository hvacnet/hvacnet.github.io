<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space.

As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
