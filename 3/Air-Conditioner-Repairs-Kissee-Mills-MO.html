<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years back and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
