<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness.
