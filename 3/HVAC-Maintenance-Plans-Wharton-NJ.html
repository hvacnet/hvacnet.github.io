<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
