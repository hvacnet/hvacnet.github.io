The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
