<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators.
