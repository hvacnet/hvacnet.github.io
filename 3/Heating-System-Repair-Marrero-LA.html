<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

<p>Great Product! Delivery was kind of strange being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved concerns. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
