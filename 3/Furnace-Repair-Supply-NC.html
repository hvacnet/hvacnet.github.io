<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
