<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Mount Pleasant TN</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that someone as skilled as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c prior to you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
