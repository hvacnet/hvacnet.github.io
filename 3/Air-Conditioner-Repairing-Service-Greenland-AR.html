<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically higher than many heat pump choices, they can still be highly effective, depending on the model you acquire.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.
