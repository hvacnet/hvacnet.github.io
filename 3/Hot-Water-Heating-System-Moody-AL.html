<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
