<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
