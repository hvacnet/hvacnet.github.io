<p>Geothermal heat pumps, as well as all other types of heat pumps, have performances ranked according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE OFFICER. It's a clinical method of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. Most geothermal heat pump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0.

Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling impact. A lot of ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0.
