<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to keep and comprehend.<p>
