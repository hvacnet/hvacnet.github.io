<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
