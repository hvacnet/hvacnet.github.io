<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is always at a consistent temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
