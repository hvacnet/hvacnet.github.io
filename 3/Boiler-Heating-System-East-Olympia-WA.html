<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
