<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
