<p>. Before choosing the installation place of ac system, a number of main elements require to be considered. First of all, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there must not be any obstacles en route of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible. The outdoor unit should likewise be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be efficiently released outdoors and the efficiency of the entire system will drop sharply.

<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
