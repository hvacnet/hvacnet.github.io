<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Switch off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2).

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
