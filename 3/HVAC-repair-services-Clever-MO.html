<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal convenience inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors.
