<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
