<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality.
