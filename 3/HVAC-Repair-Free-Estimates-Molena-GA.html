<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
