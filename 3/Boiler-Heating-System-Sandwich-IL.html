The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
