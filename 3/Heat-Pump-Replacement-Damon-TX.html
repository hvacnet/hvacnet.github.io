For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Damon TX</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine situation & chose to choose them for the work. I enjoy to say that not only did we get the central air going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from beginning to end were really expert, courteous and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The most common kind of house heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or lp to produce heat. With a typical cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive alternative, but more recent systems can be really energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems usually achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly effective gas heating systems can accomplish AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
