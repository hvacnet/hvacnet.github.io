For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many individuals.<p>

<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are utilized to seeing this key in the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements also. Split systems are perfect for cooling several rooms simultaneously, but are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the home.
