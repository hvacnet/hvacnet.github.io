<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better service. If the current system has not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense also.<p>
<p>Changing your old furnace with a new, more effective model can fight unpredictable energy costs, decreasing your heating expenses by approximately 45%. Improvements in heating innovation have led to systems that pollute less, increase convenience, and last longer. A twenty to thirty year old furnace typically has an AFUE of about 65%. The lowest effectiveness enabled by law for brand-new gas models is 78%, and there are many choices that achieve 98%, for near total efficiency.<p>
