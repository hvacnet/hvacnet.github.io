<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in North Charleston SC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Don't stress! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply might require 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat requires 24 volts of low voltage supplied by your transformer to keep the digital screen on. If 24 volts isn't acquired, you'll get a blank screen. There are several reasons that your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be talking about why you may be having difficulty with your Nest wise thermostat. Examine your emergency breakers initially. You should have the right amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the proper 120 volts of power going to the furnace, examine.
