<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
