<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might induce an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
