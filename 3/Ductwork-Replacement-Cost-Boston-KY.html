<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can afford, a lot of Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a vicious, terrible summer season.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
