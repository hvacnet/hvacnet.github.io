<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The Principles Handbook includes heating and cooling calculations. The design professional should seek advice from ASHRAE information for the requirements of design and care as the common building regulations supply little to no info on HVAC style practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much detail on installation requirements, nevertheless. Other helpful reference products include items from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
