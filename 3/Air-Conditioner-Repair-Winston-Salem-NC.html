<p>Using air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable resource section recommends that "Air Filtering ought to have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
