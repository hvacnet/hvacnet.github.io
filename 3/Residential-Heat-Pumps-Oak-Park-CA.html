Naturally, too-dry air can likewise aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors.
