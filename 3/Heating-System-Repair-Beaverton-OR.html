<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
