<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an airborne product of a biological contaminant. Biological impurities in the home might include mold, germs, infections, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols launched into the air can be distributed throughout the house by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause infectious illness such as Legionnaires' disease. They also can cause allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma.
