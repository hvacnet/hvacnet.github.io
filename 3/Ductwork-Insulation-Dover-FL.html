<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
