<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
