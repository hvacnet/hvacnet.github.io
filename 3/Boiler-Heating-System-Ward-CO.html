<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
