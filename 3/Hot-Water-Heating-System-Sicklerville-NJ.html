<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in Sicklerville NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had actually found the trouble area in examining the expense. He fixed the problem in one day, had changed the expense to what I considered fair prior to he recalled, knew what might have triggered the issue and had a plan to guarantee that it would not take place once again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>
