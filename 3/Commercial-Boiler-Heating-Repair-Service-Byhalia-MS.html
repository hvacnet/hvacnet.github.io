<p>We are service specialists! As licensed contractors and experts in the field of heating and air-conditioning, we have the tools, the equipment, and the experience to keep your devices running efficiently all year long. If it is emergency service that you need, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, we are offered to help you! To help reduce service emergencies, we provide service contracts to keep your convenience system performing at peak efficiency.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Though it may be difficult to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are many other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building products contribute to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery materials can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>When auto air conditioning systems break down, refrigerant leaks. Not only is refrigerant damaging to the environment, it's also harmful to your car. Leaking refrigerant can harm your lorry's evaporator and compressor. Getting a cars and truck air conditioning unit service at the first sign of problem will conserve you both cash and time. Pertain To Firestone Total Automobile Care for an AC service repair before any damage spreads.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
