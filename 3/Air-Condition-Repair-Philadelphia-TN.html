A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
