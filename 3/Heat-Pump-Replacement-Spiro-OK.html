They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My spouse said that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have satisfied in a long period of time.

<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
