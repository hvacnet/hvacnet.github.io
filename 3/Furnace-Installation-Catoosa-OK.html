<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
