<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job.
