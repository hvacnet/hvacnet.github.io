<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
