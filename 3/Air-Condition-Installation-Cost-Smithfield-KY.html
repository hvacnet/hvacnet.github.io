Dependable on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. However then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>There's a huge distinction between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common form of home heating-- convection.
