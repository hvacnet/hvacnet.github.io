<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects toxins from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
