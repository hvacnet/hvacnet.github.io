<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
