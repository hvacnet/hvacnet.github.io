<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation.

Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
