<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple process. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
