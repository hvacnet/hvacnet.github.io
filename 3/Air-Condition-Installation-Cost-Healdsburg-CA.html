<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
