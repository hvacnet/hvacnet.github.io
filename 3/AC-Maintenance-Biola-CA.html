<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
