<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have multiple control panel. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard.

They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months before the existing one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
