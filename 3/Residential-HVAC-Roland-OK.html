<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and harden-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
