<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. Many house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

<p>Think about an entire home dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old enough to validate replacement. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can take pleasure in some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing greater comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
