<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems.

<p>These people have actually been fantastic. At a realtor, I sometimes need contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a home might cost.

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
