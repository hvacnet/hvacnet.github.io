<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Radiant Heating System in Studio City CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that most Seattleites will only utilize moderately, however since heat pumps can supply both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds! Not just are heat pumps hassle-free, they are incredibly energy effective, too. If a heat pump remains in your future, the best time to install a/c in your home may extremely well be when your heater breaks down.<p>
<p>Its distinct feature is the presence of one primary external unit that connected to several indoor systems. Such systems may be the ideal solution for keeping the microclimate in a number of offices, shops, big living spaces. Simply few of outside units do not get worse the visual appearance of the building. The main external system can be connected to a number of various indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, and so on<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was six months before the existing one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
