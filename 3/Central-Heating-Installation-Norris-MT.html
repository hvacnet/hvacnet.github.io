<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
