<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit.

That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
