<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.

Therefore, this might not be the best alternative for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
