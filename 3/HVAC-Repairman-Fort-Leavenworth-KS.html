<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Fort Leavenworth KS</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
