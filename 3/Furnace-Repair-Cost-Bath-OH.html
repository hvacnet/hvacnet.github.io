It likewise avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
