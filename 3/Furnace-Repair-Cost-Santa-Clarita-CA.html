<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
