<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The primary reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services used. If the system is new and still under a producer's warranty, the cost might not be beneficial. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the producer's guarantee. However, some manufacturers need regular maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning, and refers to the environment control systems set up in houses or commercial properties. Their task is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the building, to keep occupants of the structure comfy. Literally every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of climate control system installed.<p>
