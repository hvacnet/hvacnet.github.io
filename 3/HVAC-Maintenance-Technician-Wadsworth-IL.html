Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be effectively vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot builds up inside the ducts, decreasing their effectiveness gradually.
