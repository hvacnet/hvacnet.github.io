<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay features when they're closed down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

Likewise, clean ducts and correct airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
