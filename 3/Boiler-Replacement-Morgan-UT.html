<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in gathering information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
