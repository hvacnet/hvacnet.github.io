In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system.
