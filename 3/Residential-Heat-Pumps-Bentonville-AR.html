Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00.

If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively.

<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may observe musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy.
