<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, babies, and kids are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
