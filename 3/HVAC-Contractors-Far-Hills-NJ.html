<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
