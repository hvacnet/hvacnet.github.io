<p>Air conditioners can create a great deal of water because they get rid of moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location.
