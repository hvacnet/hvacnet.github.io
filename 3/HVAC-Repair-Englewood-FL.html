Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
