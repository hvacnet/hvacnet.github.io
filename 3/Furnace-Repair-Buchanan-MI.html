<p>Specialist heater setups. For any contractor, HVAC or otherwise, these companies supply chances they can't accomplish by themselves. A lot of owners stick with the bigger companies after acquisition. Sometimes, the acquisition offers a way for the seller to retire and make certain workers are looked after.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
