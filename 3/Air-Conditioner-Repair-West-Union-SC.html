<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>When constructing your new house a well-functioning Heating and Cooling system is crucial, along with the air quality you breathe inside. We have the experience and resources necessary to assist from the planning stages through to the last installation. We utilize the current software application to assist develop your ductwork system and utilize the highest quality materials in the construction and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
