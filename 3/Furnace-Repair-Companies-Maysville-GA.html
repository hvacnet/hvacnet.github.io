<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature level. Heating systems that kick on often might be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately.

Poorly located outside air consumption vents can likewise bring in air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms.
