<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. For instance, promoting maintenance services to existing consumers during the sluggish season can help ease the peak season strain on your tech crew, as kept in mind in Cooling, Heating and Refrigeration (ACHR) News Technicians can mostly focus on reacting to calls from brand-new consumers, while your developed clients remain pleased as their HVAC systems hum along nicely thanks to proactive checkups.

<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the very same period.

However, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold growth and wetness inside is associated with a higher prevalence of resident breathing issues.<p>
