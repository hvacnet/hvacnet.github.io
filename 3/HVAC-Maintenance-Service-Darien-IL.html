This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
