<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
