Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
