Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your home.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house.
