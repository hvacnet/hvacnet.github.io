<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that ideal temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which normally consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
