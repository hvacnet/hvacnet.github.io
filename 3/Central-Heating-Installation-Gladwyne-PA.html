<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to assess situation & chose to choose them for the work. I enjoy to say that not only did we get the central air going however also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked with from beginning to end were very professional, considerate and the work was very efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without can be found in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
