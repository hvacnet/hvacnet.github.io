<p>Indoor air pollution is triggered by burning strong fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating.

Installations can likewise vary considerably, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. Sometimes, totally new ductwork may need to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can likewise worsen indoor air quality issues.
