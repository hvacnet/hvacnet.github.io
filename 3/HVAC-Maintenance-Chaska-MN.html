<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is truthful, dependable, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find a truthful AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
