Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
