<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
