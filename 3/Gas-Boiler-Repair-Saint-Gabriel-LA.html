<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it because it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will decrease the system's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>We advise utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
