<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%.
