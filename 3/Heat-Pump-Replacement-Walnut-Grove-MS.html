Lots of makers state on service warranty paperwork that installation and maintenance by a certified HVAC service provider are a part of the warranty conditions.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
