<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Trenton NJ</h3>
<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen. Also, if the air conditioning unit smells bad, there might be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning system's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>
