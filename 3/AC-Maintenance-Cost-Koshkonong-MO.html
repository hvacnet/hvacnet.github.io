Contaminants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into the house from the ground below. An air toxin might likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care items.

<p>The main reason house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services offered.
