<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can pay for, numerous Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a terrible, harsh summer season.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you whenever they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months before the existing one ended. She didn't require a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
