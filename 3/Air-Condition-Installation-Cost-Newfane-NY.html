After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
