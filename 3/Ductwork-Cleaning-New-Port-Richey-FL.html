<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>To protect relative with asthma or to reduce the possibility that somebody in the house may establish asthma, the house needs to be inspected for possible indoor asthma activates. Each space in the home has prospective asthma activates. Some problems can be fixed rapidly, however others may require more time and work to manage or eliminate asthma triggers. Easy-to-fix problems, such as chemical odors and fragrances, contribute to indoor air pollution and have been known to asthma signs in sensitive people. Other sources of indoor air contamination may be more difficult to reveal. For instance, the use of space deodorizers may mask the smell of mold. If the source of moldy smells can be discovered and removed, it will enhance the indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
