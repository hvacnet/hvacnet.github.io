<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but numerous use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better service. If the present system has actually not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be determined and fixed, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense also.<p>
