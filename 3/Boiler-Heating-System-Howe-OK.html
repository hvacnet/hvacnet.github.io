<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a couple of years back.<p>
<p>As a building owner or facility supervisor, you need to consider the cost of unexpected downtime and the effect older, ineffective systems have on the bottom line.
