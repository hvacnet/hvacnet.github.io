The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation.

Review of this information may recognize potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
