<p>Resideo offers a variety of energy-efficient Whole-House Ventilation System options for both brand-new construction and retrofit applications. Breathing air pollutants can cause asthmatic and allergic reactions, infections and other health problems that include the lungs, nose and throat.

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up simply a few years earlier.<p>
