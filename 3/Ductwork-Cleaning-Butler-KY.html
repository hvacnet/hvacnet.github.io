<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
