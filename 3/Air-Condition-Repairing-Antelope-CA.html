<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
