<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Murchison TX</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
