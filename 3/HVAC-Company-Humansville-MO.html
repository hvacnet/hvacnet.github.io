<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the concern and fixed really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
