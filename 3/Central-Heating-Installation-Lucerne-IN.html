<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Repair in Lucerne IN</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
