<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, as opposed to outdoor or industrial settings.

A small house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>

<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your home may not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, stinky or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To discover odors in your home, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
