<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Many common building materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Usually, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the building materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the removal process, elimination of asbestos-containing products is not constantly optimal. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is often recommended instead.<p>
