The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
