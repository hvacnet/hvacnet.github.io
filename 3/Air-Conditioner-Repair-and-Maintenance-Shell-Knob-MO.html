<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is typically higher than lots of heat pump options, they can still be highly effective, depending on the design you purchase. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating options. This means it can warm up your home to the preferred temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
