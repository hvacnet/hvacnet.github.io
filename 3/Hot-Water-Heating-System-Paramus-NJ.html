<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My oldest child constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
