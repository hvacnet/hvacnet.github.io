<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by utilizing wise technology. Martin stated the company can establish a control panel within the structure's controls that will provide information on its systems to permit real time visibility, supplying the capability to be preventative instead of reactionary.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
