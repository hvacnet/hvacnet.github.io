<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
