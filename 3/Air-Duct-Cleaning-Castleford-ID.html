<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers direct exposure to toxins throughout cooking. Improper adjustment, often suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you purchase a brand-new gas range or variety. Never use a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
