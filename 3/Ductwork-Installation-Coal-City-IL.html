<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a home. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found simply a couple of feet below ground. In the summertime, the procedure reverses, thus cooling a house by removing heat. Underground temperature level remains consistent no matter the climate, so geothermal systems supply constant and trusted cooling and heating.<p>
