<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with the house.

During the assessment on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health hazard factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new home owner I have learned how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

However, presuming they are installed correctly and properly looked after, the likelihood of them having issues is small.<p>
