<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your home, but there are numerous other contaminants that can not only unclean up the air, however result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure products add to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (volatile natural substances) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes consist of bringing in outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
