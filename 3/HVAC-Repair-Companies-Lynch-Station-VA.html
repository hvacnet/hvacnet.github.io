<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
