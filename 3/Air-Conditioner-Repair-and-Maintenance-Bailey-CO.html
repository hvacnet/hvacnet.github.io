Outdoor CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in the majority of buildings.

<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely.
