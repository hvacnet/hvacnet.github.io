<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run since it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
