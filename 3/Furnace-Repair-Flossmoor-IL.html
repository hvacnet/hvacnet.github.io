What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
