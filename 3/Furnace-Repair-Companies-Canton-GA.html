<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

Exposure to radon ends up being an issue when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings construct up inside.<p>

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
