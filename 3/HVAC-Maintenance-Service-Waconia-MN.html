<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
