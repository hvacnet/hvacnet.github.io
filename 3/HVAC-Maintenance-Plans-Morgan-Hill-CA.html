<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ may see undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your medical professional about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
