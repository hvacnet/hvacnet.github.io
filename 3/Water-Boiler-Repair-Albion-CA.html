<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
