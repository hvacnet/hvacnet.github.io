<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged.

We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
