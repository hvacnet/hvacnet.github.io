<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
