<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items.

This can lead to the potential for substantial health problems.<p>
