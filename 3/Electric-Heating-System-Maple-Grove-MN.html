Signs that can show your house may not have sufficient ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To identify smells in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Think about prospective effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted.
