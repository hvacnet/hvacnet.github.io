<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might see undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues.
