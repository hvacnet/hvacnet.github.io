Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
