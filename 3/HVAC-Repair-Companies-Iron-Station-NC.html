<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
