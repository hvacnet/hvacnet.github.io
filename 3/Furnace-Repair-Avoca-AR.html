<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for monetary freedom.

<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating system seems less like a luxury item and more like a requirement. (Besides, heated up floorings were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) However before you dedicate to what can be a major improvement job, it's best to ask yourself whether a glowing floor heating system is an appropriate solution for your specific home heating requirements.<p>
