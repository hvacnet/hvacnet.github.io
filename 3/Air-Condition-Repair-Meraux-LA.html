The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and waters down indoor impurities exhaust them from the house.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
