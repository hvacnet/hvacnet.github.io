<p>The most unsafe asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can build up and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these illness do not show up until many years after exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed disease from direct exposure to clothes and devices brought house from job websites.<p>
