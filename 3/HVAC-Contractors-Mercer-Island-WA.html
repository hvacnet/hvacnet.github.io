<p>A health questionnaire should be developed and dispersed to all concerned workers. Such a tool must recognize the number of people affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they are located within the office; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of specific health symptoms or health problems; determine all machines operated in the office; indicate the type of outdoors air pollution; and recognize prospective sources of task tension.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are prone to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems include a number of unique functions that can even more improve performance and efficiency. For example, homeowners may want to try to find one that includes an integrated filter light that will notify you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular feature to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on during the night to decrease energy costs much more. Of course, more functions indicate greater central air costs.<p>
