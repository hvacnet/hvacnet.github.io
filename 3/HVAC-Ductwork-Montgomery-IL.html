<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.. an extremely advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
