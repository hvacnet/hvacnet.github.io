<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
