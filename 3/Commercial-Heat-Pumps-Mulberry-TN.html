<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
