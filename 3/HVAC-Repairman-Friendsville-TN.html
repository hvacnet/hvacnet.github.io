<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
