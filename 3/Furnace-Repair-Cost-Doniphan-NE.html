<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently.

The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>

Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens.

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
