Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
