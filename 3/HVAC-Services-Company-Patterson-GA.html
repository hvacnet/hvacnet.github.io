<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by just using the services of a certified contractor or a licensed agent from a company or retailer to do the installation. If you pick to attempt to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed individual to do the work, in most, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the cooling system. A voided warranty won't do you any excellent ought to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the beginning and work with a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
