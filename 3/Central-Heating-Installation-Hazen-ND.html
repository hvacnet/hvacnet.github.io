<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps.

PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space cooling provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
