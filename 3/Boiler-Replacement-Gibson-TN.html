<p>While contaminants frequently found in indoor air are accountable for many hazardous effects, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are essential to produce specific illness. Individuals also react really in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air toxins. Further research is needed to much better understand which health results occur after exposure to the average pollutant concentrations discovered in homes and which take place from the greater concentrations that happen for brief periods of time.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is typically important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can sometimes be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Review of this information might identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping track of information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
