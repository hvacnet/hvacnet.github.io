Further research is needed to much better understand which health results occur after exposure to the average pollutant concentrations discovered in homes and which take place from the greater concentrations that happen for brief periods of time.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is typically important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can sometimes be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed.
