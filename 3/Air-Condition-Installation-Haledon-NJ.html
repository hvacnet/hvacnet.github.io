<p>5. Smell excellent naturally.

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off toxins.)

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
