<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove products of incomplete combustion.
