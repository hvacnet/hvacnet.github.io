<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was type of unusual being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with issues. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time.

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
