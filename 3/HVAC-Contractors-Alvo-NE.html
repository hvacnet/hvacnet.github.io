The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>. Before choosing the installation area of air conditioning system, several primary factors need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air circulation from the indoor units need to not fall on the location of rest or workspace.

The outdoor unit should also be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully released outside and the productivity of the whole system will drop sharply. It is extremely suggested to set up the a/c unit units in quickly accessible places, for more maintenance during operation.<p>
