<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
