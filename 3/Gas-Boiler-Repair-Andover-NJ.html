<h3>AC Technician in Andover NJ</h3>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
