<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c into a heatpump While room cooling offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
