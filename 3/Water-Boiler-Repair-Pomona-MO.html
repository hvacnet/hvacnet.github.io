<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limitations use dose-response data which reveal the health impacts of repetitive exposure to one particular chemical.
