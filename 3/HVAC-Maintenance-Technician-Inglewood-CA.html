<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
