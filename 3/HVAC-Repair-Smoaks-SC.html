<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively easy to determine surrogate for indoor toxins emitted by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside might trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in many structures.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
