<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
