Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
