<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated performance benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
