<p>Energy effectiveness can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are managed by multiple thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is really vital to preserving a proper temperature.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as an automobile radiator or common household ac system does.
