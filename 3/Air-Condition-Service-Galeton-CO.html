<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.
