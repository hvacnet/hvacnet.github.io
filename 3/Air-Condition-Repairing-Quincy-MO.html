<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
