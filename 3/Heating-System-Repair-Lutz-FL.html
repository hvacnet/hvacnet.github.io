<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment buildings and large residences. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
