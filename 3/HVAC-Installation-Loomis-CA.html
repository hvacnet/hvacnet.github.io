<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
