<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
