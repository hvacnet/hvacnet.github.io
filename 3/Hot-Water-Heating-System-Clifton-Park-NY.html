<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German technology". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already commonly utilized in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales male comes to your home he exists to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the options for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>
