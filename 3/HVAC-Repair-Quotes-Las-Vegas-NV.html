<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump innovations are offered to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Gas furnace not blowing hot air? Just as with switches, somebody might have shut off a gas valve and after that forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a handle that's perpendicular to the gas pipeline, turn it so it's parallel.

All-electric boilers can achieve approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
