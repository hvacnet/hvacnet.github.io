<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, as opposed to outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.
