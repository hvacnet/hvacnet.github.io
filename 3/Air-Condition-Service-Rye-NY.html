<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the system running.
