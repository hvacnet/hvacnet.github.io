However, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.

Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy.
