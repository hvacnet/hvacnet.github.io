<h3>Heating Installation in Keswick VA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Oil heaters are typically not extremely effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but the majority of do not accomplish an effectiveness higher than 90%. A few high-end brand names have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation as well since a drain needs to be set up.<p>

By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can delight in a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices.
