<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated effectiveness benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Since they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Since a system is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
