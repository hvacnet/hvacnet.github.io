<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
