<h3>Heat Ventilation And Air Conditioning in Summerfield NC</h3>
<p>We called Elite HVACS on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to examine scenario & chose to choose them for the work. I more than happy to state that not only did we get the central air going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from starting to end were very professional, courteous and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The main reason house owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services used. If the system is new and still under a producer's warranty, the cost may not be rewarding. Any major repairs need to be covered under the manufacturer's guarantee. However, some producers need routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
