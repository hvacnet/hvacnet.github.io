<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in delay features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
