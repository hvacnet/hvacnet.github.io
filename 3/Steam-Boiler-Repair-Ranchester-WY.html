<p>The first ac system and fridges used combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
