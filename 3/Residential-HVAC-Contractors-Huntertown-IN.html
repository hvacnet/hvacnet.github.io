<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
