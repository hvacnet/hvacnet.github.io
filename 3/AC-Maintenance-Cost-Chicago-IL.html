<p>Remember, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a home heater, you may search for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller sized wall-mounted units, ductless splits permit you to prevent the need for a full duct system like a lot of other cooling systems require. You will also enjoy a far more flexible system in regards to installation and cost. And because each indoor system has its own thermostat, you can bid farewell to thermostat warfare when someone would prefer it a little warmer in a different space.<p>
