<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies.

However, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
