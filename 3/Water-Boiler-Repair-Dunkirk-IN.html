<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that gathers throughout summers. The best thing to do is making certain that the heating system burners are inspected and cleaned completely before colder seasons begin. Always make sure that the furnace is cleaned up every year to prevent soot and condensation which triggers burners to stop working effectively. Possibly it is time to start thinking about buying a brand-new one if your furnace is in an extremely poor condition.<p>

<h3>Electric Heating System in Dunkirk IN</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
<p>They have actually not traditionally offered remote or virtual services due to the fact that HVAC technicians need to be physically present to do their work. However, with the value of social distancing due to COVID-19, the requirement for remote abilities is greater than ever.
