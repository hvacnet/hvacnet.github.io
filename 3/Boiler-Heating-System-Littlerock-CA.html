<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often essential to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping track of information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this information might identify potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, monitoring information might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
