<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
