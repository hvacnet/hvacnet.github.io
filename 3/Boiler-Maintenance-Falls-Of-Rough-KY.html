Because it tires warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow limitation will reduce the unit's performance. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we advise using our insulation boards. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of permitting heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
