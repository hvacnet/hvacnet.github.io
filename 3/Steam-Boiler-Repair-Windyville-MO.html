<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Windyville MO?</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and problem in breathing in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may activate attacks in people with asthma. There is proof that some individuals can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has actually also been revealed to trigger cancer in animals and might trigger cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
