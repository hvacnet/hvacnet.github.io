<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Alhambra CA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by numerous people.<p>
