<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-lived indoor air quality problem is developed merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated problems-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods below may be appropriate.<p>
