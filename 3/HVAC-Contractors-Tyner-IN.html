<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
