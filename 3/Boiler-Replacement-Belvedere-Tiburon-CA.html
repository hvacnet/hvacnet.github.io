<h3>Furnace Replacement in Belvedere Tiburon CA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
