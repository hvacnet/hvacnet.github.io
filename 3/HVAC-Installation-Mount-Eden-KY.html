<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was type of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window.

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material acquired with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the inspection on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace declaring health threat reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new resident I have found out how to identify the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

This is typically used in a third-floor or second location and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might pick to change the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit.

Nevertheless, thinking about recent modifications in refrigerants and cooling designs, it might be wiser to change the whole system.<p>
