<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the prospective to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if necessary, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs.
