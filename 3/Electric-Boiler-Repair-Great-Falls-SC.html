<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<h3>Benefits of Expert AC Repair in Great Falls SC</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require reasonably little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is necessary to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leaks, the system should be flushed occasionally to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems should be examined at least two times each year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to eliminate dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers more information on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
