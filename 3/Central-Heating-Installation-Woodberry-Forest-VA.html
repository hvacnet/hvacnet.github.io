<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter as soon as every three months. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
