<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might enter close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
