<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
