<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the home. Toxins could come from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and infections, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>Think about possible results of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system.

While a space heater remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
