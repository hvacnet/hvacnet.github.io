<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
