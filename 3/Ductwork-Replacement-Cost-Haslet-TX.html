<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
