<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a referral later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
