The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and assists tire them from the home.<p>
