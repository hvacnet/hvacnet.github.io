The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop needed depends on the heating & cooling requirements for your home and is crucial iin making sure the performance and performance of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is determined in loads. Normally, a 3-ton setup must be sufficient for the typical house, but house size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land schedule are all aspects which will influence the proper size for your particular home.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely specify the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outside air that must be constantly provided in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation combined with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>

The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy.
