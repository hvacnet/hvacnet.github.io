The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
