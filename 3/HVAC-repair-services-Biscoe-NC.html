<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
