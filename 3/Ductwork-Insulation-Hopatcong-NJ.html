<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

Also, if the ac system smells bad, there might be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>In most cases, if materials have actually failed to dry out numerous days after the suspected water occasion, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not instantly visible.

In a situation where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been jeopardized, mold removal may be required.
