<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.
