<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
