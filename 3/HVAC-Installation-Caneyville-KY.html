<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Caneyville KY?</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
