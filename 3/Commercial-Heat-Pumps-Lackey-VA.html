<h3>Central Heating Installation in Lackey VA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>With the cost of electricity and gas increasing, it's important to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy savings. This will keep you from unnecessarily paying more than you should. Paragon Heating & Home Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Inspection of your furnace includes a Performance Check-Up, in which the thermostat is looked for precision and the burners are changed for maximum performance. Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions DOES NOT use the ineffective 'eyeball the flame' method that other companies use. Rather, the combustion is enhanced by measuring the exhaust gasses and making clinical adjustments. This alone could pay for the entire maintenance see at today's rate of gas.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who described our options did an excellent task in ensuring we comprehended the benefits and drawbacks of each option. The service technicians who installed the new system were expert and quick, while requiring time to make sure we understood how the new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
