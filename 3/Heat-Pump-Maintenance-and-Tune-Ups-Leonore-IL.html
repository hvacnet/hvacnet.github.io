<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Leonore IL Home Owners</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home construction is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.

The lack of moving parts indicates you're less likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're considerably more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
