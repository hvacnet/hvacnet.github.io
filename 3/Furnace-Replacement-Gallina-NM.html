<p>All Points Heating offers home air conditioning, air conditioning unit installation, air conditioning unit maintenance that deliver trustworthy, tested performance at high effectiveness. Combustion products from car exhaust, heaters, hot water heater, area heaters, aromatic candle lights, oil lights, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not appropriately vented can generate carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products may result in nose, eye, and throat irritation; tiredness; lightheadedness; and nausea.<p>

And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset.

Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
