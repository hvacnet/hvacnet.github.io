<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
