<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Front Royal VA</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>The main factor homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the quantity of services offered. The cost might not be rewarding if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's service warranty. Any significant repairs must be covered under the maker's warranty. However, some producers require routine maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
