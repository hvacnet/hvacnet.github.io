My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>
