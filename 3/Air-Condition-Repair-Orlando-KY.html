<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.
