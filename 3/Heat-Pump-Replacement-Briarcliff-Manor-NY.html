<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Briarcliff Manor NY</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat distribution over the whole surface area of a flooring heats the lower half of the space, enveloping inhabitants in warmth at a lower overall temperature-- in many cases as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating system." Simply put, in-floor heater provide a different mode and level of convenience.
