<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and homes matters, especially given that we spend the majority of our lives indoors. A/c assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very damp environments or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your home.

<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts.

When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
