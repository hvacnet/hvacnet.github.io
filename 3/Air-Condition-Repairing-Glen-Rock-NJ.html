<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
