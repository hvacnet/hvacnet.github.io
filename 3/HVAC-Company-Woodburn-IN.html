<p>A geothermal heating system is more trustworthy than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external elements, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar energy relies on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reliable  source of energy.<p>

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Woodburn IN</h3>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
